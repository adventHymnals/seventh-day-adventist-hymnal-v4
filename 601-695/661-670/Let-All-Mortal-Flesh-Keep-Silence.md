[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFbM1NMMu7UyUgLxJfJV7WBaqoXH9IDR/edit?mode=html)






    1.
    Let all mortal flesh keep silence,
    And with fear and trembling stand;
    Ponder nothing earthly-minded,
    For with blessing in his hand,
    Christ our God to earth descendeth,
    Our full homage to demand. Amen.
