    1.
    Fight the good fight with all thy might;
    Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;
    Lay hold on life and it shall be
    Thy joy and crown eternally.

    2.
    Run the straight race through God’s good grace;
    Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face.
    Life with its path before us lies;
    Christ is the way, and Christ the prize.

    3.
    Cast care aside, lean on thy guide,
    His boundless mercy will provide;
    Trust, and the trusting soul shall prove
    Christ is its life, and Christ its love.

    4.
    Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near;
    He changeth not, and thou art dear.
    Only believe, and thou shalt see
    That Christ is all in all to thee.
