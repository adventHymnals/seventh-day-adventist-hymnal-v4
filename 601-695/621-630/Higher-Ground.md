    1.
    I’m pressing on the upward way,
    New heights I’m gaining every day;
    Still praying as I’m onward bound,
    “Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”


    Refrain:
    Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
    By faith, on Heaven’s table land,
    A higher plane than I have found;
    Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.


    2.
    My heart has no desire to stay
    Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
    Though some may dwell where those abound,
    My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.


    Refrain:
    Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
    By faith, on Heaven’s table land,
    A higher plane than I have found;
    Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

    3.
    I want to live above the world,
    Though Satan’s darts at me are hurled;
    For faith has caught the joyful sound,
    The song of saints on higher ground.


    Refrain:
    Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
    By faith, on Heaven’s table land,
    A higher plane than I have found;
    Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

    4.
    I want to scale the utmost height
    And catch a gleam of glory bright;
    But still I’ll pray till Heav’n I’ve found,
    “Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”

    Refrain:
    Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
    By faith, on Heaven’s table land,
    A higher plane than I have found;
    Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
