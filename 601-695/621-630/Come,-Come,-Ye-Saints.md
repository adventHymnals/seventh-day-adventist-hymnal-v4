    1.
    Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear;
    But with joy wend your way.
    Though hard to you the journey may appear,
    Grace shall be as your day.
    We will have a living lord to guide,
    And we can trust Him to provide;
    Do this, and joy your hearts will swell:All is well! All is well!

    2.
    We’ll find the rest which God for us prepared,
    When at last He will call;
    Where none will come to hurt or make afraid,
    He will reign over all.
    We will make the air with music ring,
    Shout praise to God our Lord and King:
    O how we’ll make the chorus swell:
    All is well! All is well!
