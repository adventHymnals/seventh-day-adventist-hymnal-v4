    1.
    Holy Spirit, hear us;
    Help us while we sing;
    Breath into the music
    Of the praise we bring.

    2.
    Holy Spirit, prompt us
    When we kneel to pray;
    Nearer come, and teach us
    What we ought to say.

    3.
    Holy Spirit, shine Thou
    On the Book we read;
    Gild itâ€™s holy pages
    With the light we need.
