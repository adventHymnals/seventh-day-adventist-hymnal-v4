    1.
    May God be with you Till we meet again,
    May God be with you, Keep you safe till then;
    And may His blessings Be within your heart,
    May God be with you While we’re apart,
    May God be with you.

    2.
    May God be with you, Watch you from above,
    May God protect you in His tender love;
    And with the dawning Of each bright, new day,
    May God be with you, To guide your way,
    May God be with you.
