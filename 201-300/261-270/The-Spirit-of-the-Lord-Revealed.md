    1.
    The Spirit of the Lord revealed
    His will to saints of old;
    Their heart and mind lips unsealed
    His glory to unfold.
    Amid the gloom of ancient night
    They hailed the dawning Word,
    And in the coming of the light
    Proclaimed the coming Lord.

    2.
    The prophets passed; at length there came
    To sojourn and abide,
    The Word incarnate, to whose name
    The prophets testified;
    And He, the twilight overpast,
    Himself, the Light of light,
    As man with man, revealed at last
    The Father to our sight.

    3.
    Eternal Spirit, who dost speak
    To mind and conscience still,
    That we in this our day, may seek
    To do our Fatherâ€™s will,
    To us the word of life impart,
    Of Christ, the living way;
    Give us the quiet, humble heart
    To hear and to obey.
