    1.
    Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
    With all Thy quickening powers;
    Kindle a flame of sacred love
    In these cold hearts of ours.

    2.
    O raise our thoughts from things below,
    From vanities and toys!
    Then shall we with fresh courage go
    To reach eternal joys.

    3.
    Awake our souls to joyful songs;
    Let pure devotions rise;
    Till praise employs our thankful tongues,
    And doubt forever dies.

    4.
    Father, we would no longer live
    At this poor, dying rate;
    To Thee our thankful love we give,
    For Thine to us is great.

    5.
    Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
    With all Thy quickening powers;
    Come, shed abroad a Saviorâ€™s love,
    And that shall kindle ours.
