    1.
    Spirit divine, attend our prayers,
    And make this house Thy home;
    Descend with all Thy gracious powers,
    O come, great Spirit, come!

    2.
    Come as the light; to us reveal
    Our emptiness and woe,
    And lead us in those paths of life
    Where-on the righteous go.

    3.
    Come as the fire, and purge our hearts
    Like sacrificial flame;
    Let our whole soul an of – f’ring be
    To our Redeemer’s name.

    4.
    Come as the dove, and spread Thy wings,
    The wings of peaceful love;
    And let Thy church on earth become
    Blest as the church above.

    5.
    Spirit divine, attend our prayers,
    Make a lost world Thy home;
    Descend with all Thy gracious powers,
    O come, great Spirit, come!
