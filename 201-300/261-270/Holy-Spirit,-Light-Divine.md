    1.
    Holy Spirit, light divine,
    Shine upon this heart of mine,
    Chase the shades of night away,
    Turn my darkness into day.

    2.
    Holy Spirit, power divine,
    Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
    Long has sin, without control,
    Held dominion o’er my soul.

    3.
    Holy Ghost, with joy divine,
    Cheer this saddened heart of mine,
    Bid my many woes depart,
    Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.

    4.
    Holy Spirit, all divine,
    Dwell within this heart of mine,
    Cast down every idol throne,
    Reign supreme, and reign alone.
