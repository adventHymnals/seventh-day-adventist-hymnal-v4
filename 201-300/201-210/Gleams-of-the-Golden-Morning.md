    1.
    The golden morning is fast approaching;
    Jesus soon will come
    To take his faithful and happy children
    to their promised home


    Refrain:
    O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
    piercing thro’ this night of gloom!
    O, see the gleams of the golden morning
    that will burst the tomb.


    2.
    The gospel summons will soon be carried
    to the nations round;
    The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry
    and the trumpet sound.


    Refrain:
    O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
    piercing thro’ this night of gloom!
    O, see the gleams of the golden morning
    that will burst the tomb.

    3.
    Attended by all the shining angels,
    Down the flaming sky
    the Judge will come, and will take his people
    where they will not die.


    Refrain:
    O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
    piercing thro’ this night of gloom!
    O, see the gleams of the golden morning
    that will burst the tomb.

    4.
    The lov’d of earth who have long been parted,
    Meet in that glad day;
    The tears of those who are broken hearted
    shall be wiped away.

    Refrain:
    O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
    piercing thro’ this night of gloom!
    O, see the gleams of the golden morning
    that will burst the tomb.
