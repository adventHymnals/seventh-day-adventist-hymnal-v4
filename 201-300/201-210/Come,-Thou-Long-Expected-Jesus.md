    1.
    Come, thou long expected Jesus!
    born to set thy people free;
    from our fears and sins release us,
    let us find our rest in thee.
    Israelâ€™s strength and consolation,
    hope of all the earth thou art;
    dear desire of every nation,
    joy of every longing heart.

    2.
    Born thy people to deliver,
    born a child and yet a King,
    born to reign in us forever,
    now thy gracious kingdom bring.
    By thine own eternal spirit
    rule in all our hearts alone;
    by thine all sufficient merit,
    raise us to thy glorious throne.
