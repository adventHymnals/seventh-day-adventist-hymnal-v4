    1.
    The great Physician now is near,
    The sympathizing Jesus;
    He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
    Oh! hear the voice of Jesus.


    Refrain:
    Sweetest note in seraph song,
    Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
    Sweetest carol ever sung,
    Jesus, blessed Jesus.


    2.
    Your many sins are all forgiven,
    Oh! hear the voice of Jesus;
    Go on your way in peace to heaven,
    And wear a crown with Jesus.


    Refrain:
    Sweetest note in seraph song,
    Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
    Sweetest carol ever sung,
    Jesus, blessed Jesus.

    3.
    All glory to the dying Lamb!
    I now believe in Jesus;
    I love the blessed Savior’s name,
    I love the name of Jesus.


    Refrain:
    Sweetest note in seraph song,
    Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
    Sweetest carol ever sung,
    Jesus, blessed Jesus.

    4.
    His name dispels my guilt and fear,
    No other name but Jesus;
    Oh! how my soul delights to hear
    The charming name of Jesus.

    Refrain:
    Sweetest note in seraph song,
    Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
    Sweetest carol ever sung,
    Jesus, blessed Jesus.
