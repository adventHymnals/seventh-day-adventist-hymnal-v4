    1.
    Christ is the world’s light,
    Christ and none other;
    born in our darkness,
    He became our brother-
    if we have seen Him,
    we have seen the Father:
    Glory to God on high!

    2.
    Christ is the world’s peace,
    Christ and none other;
    no one can serve Him,
    and despise another.
    Who else unites us,
    one in God the Father?
    Glory to God on high!

    3.
    Christ is the world’s life,
    Christ and none other;
    sold once for silver,
    murdered here, our brother-
    He, who redeems us,
    reigns with God the Father:
    Glory to God on high!

    4.
    Give God the glory,
    God and none other;
    give God the glory,
    Spirit, Son and Father;
    give God the glory,
    God-with-us our brother:
    Glory to God on high!
