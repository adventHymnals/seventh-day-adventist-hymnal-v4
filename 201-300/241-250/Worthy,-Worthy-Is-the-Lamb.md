    1.
    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
    That was slain.


    Refrain:
    Glory, hallelujah!
    Praise Him, hallelujah!
    Glory, hallelujah!
    To the Lamb!


    2.
    Savior, let Thy kingdom come!
    Now the power of sin consume;
    Bring Thy blest millennium,
    Holy Lamb.


    Refrain:
    Glory, hallelujah!
    Praise Him, hallelujah!
    Glory, hallelujah!
    To the Lamb!

    3.
    Thus may we
    each moment feel,
    Love Him, serve Him,
    praise Him still,
    Till we all on Zionâ€™s hill
    See the Lamb.

    Refrain:
    Glory, hallelujah!
    Praise Him, hallelujah!
    Glory, hallelujah!
    To the Lamb!
