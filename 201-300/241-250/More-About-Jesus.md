    1.
    More about Jesus, I would know,
    More of His grace to others show;
    More of His saving fullness see,
    More of His love who died for me.


    Refrain:
    More, more about Jesus,
    More, more about Jesus;
    More of His saving fullness see,
    More of His love who died for me.


    2.
    More about Jesus, let me learn,
    More of His holy will discern;
    Spirit of God, my teacher be,
    Showing the things of Christ to me.


    Refrain:
    More, more about Jesus,
    More, more about Jesus;
    More of His saving fullness see,
    More of His love who died for me.

    3.
    More about Jesus, in His word,
    Holding communion with my Lord;
    Hearing His voice in every line,
    Making each faithful saying mine.


    Refrain:
    More, more about Jesus,
    More, more about Jesus;
    More of His saving fullness see,
    More of His love who died for me.

    4.
    More about Jesus, on His throne,
    Riches in glory all His own;
    More of His kingdomâ€™s sure increase,
    More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

    Refrain:
    More, more about Jesus,
    More, more about Jesus;
    More of His saving fullness see,
    More of His love who died for me.
