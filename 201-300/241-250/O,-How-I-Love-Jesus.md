    1.
    There is a Name I love to hear,
    I love to sing its worth;
    It sounds like music in my ears,
    The sweetest Name on earth.


    Refrain:
    O how I love Jesus,
    O how I love Jesus,
    O how I love Jesus,
    Because He first loved me.


    2.
    It tells me of a Savior’s love,
    Who died to set me free;
    It tells me of a Savior’s blood,
    The sinners’ perfect plea.


    Refrain:
    O how I love Jesus,
    O how I love Jesus,
    O how I love Jesus,
    Because He first loved me.

    3.
    It tells of one whose loving heart
    Can feel my deepest woe;
    Who in each sorrow bears
    A part that none can bear below.

    Refrain:
    O how I love Jesus,
    O how I love Jesus,
    O how I love Jesus,
    Because He first loved me.
