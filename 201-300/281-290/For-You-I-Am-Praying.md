    1.
    I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,
    A dear, loving Savior, though earth friends be few;
    And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me,
    But oh that my Savior were your Savior, too.


    Refrain:
    For you I am praying, For you I am Praying,
    For you am I praying, I’m praying for you.


    2.
    I have a Father; to me He has given
    A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
    And soon He will call to meet Him in heaven,
    But oh that He’d let me bring you with me, too!


    Refrain:
    For you I am praying, For you I am Praying,
    For you am I praying, I’m praying for you.

    3.
    I have a robe; ’tis resplendent in whiteness,
    Awaiting in glory my wondering view;
    Oh, when I receive it, all shining in brightness,
    Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too!


    Refrain:
    For you I am praying, For you I am Praying,
    For you am I praying, I’m praying for you.

    4.
    When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,
    That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;
    Then pray that your Savior will bring them to glory,
    And prayer will be answered-’twas answered for you!

    Refrain:
    For you I am praying, For you I am Praying,
    For you am I praying, I’m praying for you.
