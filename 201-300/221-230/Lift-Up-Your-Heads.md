    1.
    Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!
    Behold the King of glory waits;
    The King of kings is drawing near,
    The Savior of the world is here.

    2.
    The Lord is just, a helper tried;
    Mercy is ever at His side;
    His kingly crowns is holiness,
    His scepter, pity in distress.

    3.
    O blest the land, the city blest,
    Where Christ the Ruler is confessed!
    O happy hearts and happy homes
    To whom this King in triumph comes!

    4.
    Fling wide the portals of your heart;
    Make it a temple, set apart
    From earthly use for heaven’s employ,
    Adorned with prayer, and love, and joy.

    5.
    Redeemer, come; I open wide
    My heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide.
    Let me Thy inner presence feel,
    Thy grace and love in me reveal.
