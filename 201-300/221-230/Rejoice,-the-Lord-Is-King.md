    1.
    Rejoice, the Lord is King! Your Lord and King adore!
    Rejoice, give thanks, and sing and triumph evermore
    Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
    Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

    2.
    Jesus, the Savior, reigns, The God of truth and love;
    When He had purged our stains, He took His seat above
    Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
    Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

    3.
    His kingdom cannot fail, He rules oâ€™er earth and heaven
    The keys of death and grave Are to our Jesus given
    Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
    Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

    4.
    Rejoice in glorious hope! Our Lord the judge shall come,
    And take His servants up To their eternal home
    Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
    Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
