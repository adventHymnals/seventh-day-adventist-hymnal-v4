    Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race, ye ransomed from the fall,
    Hail Him who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all.

    Let every kindred, every tribe on this terrestrial ball
    To Him all majesty ascribe, and crown Him Lord of all.

    O that with yonder angel throng we at His feet may fall!
    We’ll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all.
    We’ll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all.
