#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
O sing a song of Bethlehem,
Of shepherds watching there,
And of the news that came to them
From angels in the air:
The light that shone on Bethlehem
Fills all the world today;
Of Jesus’birth and peace on earth
The angels sing alway.

2.
O sing a song of Nazareth,
Of sunny days of joy,
O sing of fragrant flowers breath,
And of the sinless Boy:
For now the flowers of Nazareth
In every heart may grow;
Now spreads the fame of His dear name
On all the winds that blow.

3.
O sing a song of Calvary,
Its glory and dismay;
Of Him who hung upon the tree,
And took our sins away:
For He who died on Calvary
Is risen from the grave;
And Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored,
Is mighty now to save.
