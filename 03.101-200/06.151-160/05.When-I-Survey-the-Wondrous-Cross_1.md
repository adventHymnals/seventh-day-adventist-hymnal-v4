#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt

1.
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

2.
See, from His head, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

3.
Since I, who was undone and lost,
Have pardon through His name and word;
Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
Save in the cross of Christ my Lord.

4.
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a tribute far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my life, my soul, my all.
