## 177. JESUS, YOUR BLOOD AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Jesus, your blood and righteousness
My beauty are, my glorious dress;
Mid flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.

2.
Bold shall I stand in that great day,
Cleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;
For by your cross absolved I am
From sin and guilt, from fear and shame.

3.
Lord, I believe your precious blood,
Which at the mercy seat of God
Pleads for the captivesâ€™ liberty,
Was also shed in love for me.

4.
When from the dust of death I rise
To claim my mansion in the skies,
This then shall be my only plea:
Christ Jesus lived and died for me.
