#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
The advent of our God
With eager prayers we greet,
And singing haste upon His road
His coming reign to meet.

2.
The everlasting Son
Was born to make us free;
And He a servantâ€™s form put on
To gain our liberty.

3.
As Judge, on clouds of light,
He soon will come again,
His scattered people to unite
With them in heaven to reign.

4.
Praise to the incarnate Son
Who comes to set us free,
With Father, Spirit, ever one,
To all eternity.
