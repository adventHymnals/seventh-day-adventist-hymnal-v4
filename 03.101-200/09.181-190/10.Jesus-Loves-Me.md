Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong


Refrain:
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me! He wo died
Heavenâ€™s gate to open wide:
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in.

Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
The Bible tells me so.

3.
Jesus, take this heart of mine,
Make it pure and wholly thine;
On the coross You died for me,
I will love and live for Thee.

Refrain:
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
The Bible tells me so.
