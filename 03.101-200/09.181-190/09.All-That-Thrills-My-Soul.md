#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
By His presence all divine?
True and tender, pure and precious,
Oh, how blest to call Him mine!


Refrain:
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me; (to me;)
And the fairest of ten thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.


2.
Love of Christ so freely given,
Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea.


Refrain:
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me; (to me;)
And the fairest of ten thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.

3.
Every need His hand supplying,
Every good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying,
He is All in All to me.


Refrain:
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me; (to me;)
And the fairest of ten thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.

4.
By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King.

Refrain:
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me; (to me;)
And the fairest of ten thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.
