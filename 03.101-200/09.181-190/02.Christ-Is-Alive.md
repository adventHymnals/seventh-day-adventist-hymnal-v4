## 182. CHRIST IS ALIVE
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Christ is alive!
Let Christians sing.
His cross stands empty to the sky.
Let streets and homes with praises ring.
His love in death shall never die.

2.
Christ is alive!
No longer bound
To distant years in Palestine,
He comes to claim the here and now
And conquer every place and time.

3.
In every insult,
rift, and war
Where color, scorn or wealth divide,
He suffers still, yet loves the more,
And lives, though ever crucified.

4.
Christ is alive!
Ascended Lord
He rules the world His Father made,
Till, in the end, His love adored
Shall be to all on earth displayed.
