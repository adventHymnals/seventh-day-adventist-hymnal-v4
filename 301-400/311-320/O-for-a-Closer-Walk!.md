    1.
    O for a closer walk with God,
    A calm and heavenly frame,
    A light to shine upon the road
    That leads me to the Lamb!

    2.
    Return, O holy Dove, return,
    Sweet messenger of rest!
    I hate the sins that made Thee mourn
    And drove Thee from my breast.

    3.
    What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
    How sweet their memory still!
    But they have left an aching void
    The world can never fill.

    4.
    The dearest idol I have known,
    What-eâ€™er that idol be,
    Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
    And worship only Thee.
