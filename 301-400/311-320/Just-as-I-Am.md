    1.
    Just as I am, without one plea,
    But that Thy blood was shed for me,
    And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    2.
    Just as I am, and waiting not
    To rid my soul of one dark blot,
    To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    3.
    Just as I am, though tossed about
    With many a conflict, many a doubt,
    “Fightings within, and fears without,”
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    4.
    Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
    Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
    Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    5.
    Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
    Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
    Because Thy promise I believe,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    6.
    Just as I am, Thy love I own
    Has broken every barrier down;
    Now, to be Thine, and Thine alone,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
