    1.
    O Jesus Christ, to You may hymns be rising
    In every city for Your love and care;
    Inspire our worship, grant the glad surprising
    That Your blest Spirit brings men everywhere.

    2.
    Grant us new courage sacrificial humble
    Strong in Your strength to venture and to dare,
    To lift the fallen, guide the feet that stumble,
    Seek out the lonely &amp;God’s mercy share

    3.
    Show us Your Spirit, brooding oér each city,
    As You did weep above Jerusalem,
    Seeking to gather all in love and pity,
    And healing those who touch Your garment’s hem.
