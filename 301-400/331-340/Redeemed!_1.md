    1.
    Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed throâ€™ His infinite mercy,
    His child, and forever, I am.


    Refrain:
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
    His child and forever I am.


    2.
    I think of my blessed Redeemer,
    I think of Him all the day long;
    I sing, for I cannot be silent;
    His love is the theme of my song.


    Refrain:
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
    His child and forever I am.

    3.
    I know I shall see in His beauty
    The King in whose law I delight,
    Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
    And giveth me songs in the night.

    Refrain:
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
    His child and forever I am.
