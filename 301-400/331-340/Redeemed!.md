    1.
    Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
    His child and forever I am.


    Refrain:
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    His child and forever I am.


    2.
    Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,
    No language my rapture can tell;
    I know that the light of His presence
    With me doth continually dwell.


    Refrain:
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    His child and forever I am.

    3.
    I know there’s a crown that is waiting
    In yonder bright mansion for me;
    And soon, with the spirit made perfect,
    At home with the Lord I shall be.

    Refrain:
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    His child and forever I am.
