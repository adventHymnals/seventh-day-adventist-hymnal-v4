    1.
    God is my strong salvation,
    What foe have I to fear?
    In darkness and temptation,
    My Light, my Help, is near:
    Though hosts encamp around me,
    Firm in the fight I stand;
    What terror can confound me,
    With God at my right hand?

    2.
    Place on the reliance;
    My soul with courage wait;
    His truth be thine affiance,
    When faint and desolate.
    His might thy heart shall strengthen,
    His love thy joy increase;
    Mercy thy days shall lengthen;
    The Lord will give thee peace.
