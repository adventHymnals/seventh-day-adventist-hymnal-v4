    1.
    O Jesus, I have promised
    to serve thee to the end;
    be thou forever near me,
    my Master and my friend.
    I shall not fear the battle
    if thou art by my side,
    nor wander from the pathway
    if thou wilt be my guide.

    2.
    O let me feel thee near me!
    The world is ever near;
    I see the sights that dazzle,
    the tempting sounds I hear;
    my foes are ever near me,
    around me and within;
    but Jesus, draw thou nearer,
    and shield my soul from sin.

    3.
    O Jesus, thou hast promised
    to all who follow thee
    that where thou art in glory
    there shall thy servant be.
    And Jesus, I have promised
    to serve thee to the end;
    O give me grace to follow,
    my Master and my Friend.
