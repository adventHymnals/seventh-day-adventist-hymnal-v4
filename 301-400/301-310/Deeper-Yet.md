    1.
    In the blood from the cross,
    I have been washed from sin;
    But to be free from dross,
    Still I would enter in.


    Refrain:
    Deeper yet, deeper yet,
    Into the crimson flood;
    Deeper yet, deeper yet,
    Under the precious blood.


    2.
    Day by day, hour by hour,
    Blessings are sent to me;
    But for more of His power,
    Ever my prayer shall be.


    Refrain:
    Deeper yet, deeper yet,
    Into the crimson flood;
    Deeper yet, deeper yet,
    Under the precious blood.

    3.
    Near to Christ I would live,
    Following Him each day;
    What I ask He will give;
    So then with faith I pray.


    Refrain:
    Deeper yet, deeper yet,
    Into the crimson flood;
    Deeper yet, deeper yet,
    Under the precious blood.

    4.
    Now I have peace, sweet peace,
    While in this world of sin;
    But to pray Iâ€™ll not cease
    Till I am pure within.

    Refrain:
    Deeper yet, deeper yet,
    Into the crimson flood;
    Deeper yet, deeper yet,
    Under the precious blood.
