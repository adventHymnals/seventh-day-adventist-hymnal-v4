    1.
    I am coming to the cross;
    I am poor and weak and blind;
    I am counting all but dross;
    I shall full salvation find.


    Refrain:
    I am trusting, Lord, in Thee.
    O thou Lamb of Calvary;
    Humbly at Thy cross I bow.
    Save me, Jesus, save me now.


    2.
    Long my heart has sighed for Thee;
    Long has evil reigned within;
    Jesus sweetly speaks to me:
    “I will cleanse you from all sin.”


    Refrain:
    I am trusting, Lord, in Thee.
    O thou Lamb of Calvary;
    Humbly at Thy cross I bow.
    Save me, Jesus, save me now.

    3.
    Here I give my all to Thee:
    Friends and time and earthly store;
    Soul and body Thine to be,
    Wholly Thine forevermore.


    Refrain:
    I am trusting, Lord, in Thee.
    O thou Lamb of Calvary;
    Humbly at Thy cross I bow.
    Save me, Jesus, save me now.

    4.
    Jesus comes! He fills my soul!
    Perfected in Him I am;
    I am every whit made whole:
    Glory, glory to the Lamb!

    Refrain:
    I am trusting, Lord, in Thee.
    O thou Lamb of Calvary;
    Humbly at Thy cross I bow.
    Save me, Jesus, save me now.
