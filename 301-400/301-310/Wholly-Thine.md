    1.
    I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;
    Teach me how, teach me how;
    I would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;
    Help me, help me now.


    Refrain:
    Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,
    Wholly Thine, this is my vow;
    Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,
    Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.


    2.
    What is worldly pleasure, wealth or fame,
    Without Thee, without Thee?
    I will leave them all for Thy dear Name,
    This my wealth shall be.


    Refrain:
    Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,
    Wholly Thine, this is my vow;
    Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,
    Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.

    3.
    As I cast earth’s transient joys behind,
    Come Thou near, come Thou near;
    In Thy presence all in all I find,
    ’Tis my comfort here.

    Refrain:
    Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,
    Wholly Thine, this is my vow;
    Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,
    Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.
