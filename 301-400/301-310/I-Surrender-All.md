    1.
    All to Jesus I surrender;
    all to him I freely give;
    I will ever love and trust him,
    in his presence daily live.


    Refrain:
    I surrender all, I surrender all,
    all to thee, my blessed Savior,
    I surrender all.


    2.
    All to Jesus I surrender;
    humbly at his feet I bow,
    worldly pleasures all forsaken;
    take me, Jesus, take me now.


    Refrain:
    I surrender all, I surrender all,
    all to thee, my blessed Savior,
    I surrender all.

    3.
    All to Jesus I surrender;
    make me, Savior, wholly thine;
    fill me with thy love and power;
    truly know that thou art mine.

    I surrender all, I surrender all,
    all to thee, my blessed Savior,
    I surrender all.

    4.
    All to Jesus I surrender;
    now I feel the sacred flame.
    O the joy of full salvation!
    Glory, glory, to his name!

    Refrain:
    I surrender all, I surrender all,
    all to thee, my blessed Savior,
    I surrender all.
