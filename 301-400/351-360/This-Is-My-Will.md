    1.
    This is My will, My one command,
    That love should dwell among you all.
    This is My will that you should love
    As I have shown that I love you.

    2.
    No greater love a man can have
    Than that he die to save his friends.
    You are My friends if you obey
    What I command that you should do.

    3.
    You chose not Me, but I chose you
    That you should go and bear much fruit.
    I chose you out that you in Me
    Should bear much fruit that will abide.

    4.
    All that I ask My Father, dear,
    For My nameâ€™s sake you shall receive.
    This is My will, My one command,
    That love should dwell in each, in all.
