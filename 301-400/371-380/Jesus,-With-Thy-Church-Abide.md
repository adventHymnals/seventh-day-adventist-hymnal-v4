    1.
    Jesus, with Thy church abide;
    Be her Savior, Lord, and Guide,
    While on earth her faith is tried:
    We beseech Thee, hear us.

    2.
    May her voice be ever clear,
    Warning of a judgment near,
    Telling of a Savior dear:
    We beseech Thee, hear us.

    3.
    May she guide the poor and blind,
    Seek the lost until she find,
    And the broken hearted bind:
    We beseech Thee, hear us.

    4.
    May she holy triumps win,
    Overthrow the hosts of sin,
    Gather all the nations in:
    We beseech Thee, hear us.
