## 397.  397. An Upper Room
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13VUIM0HO3MiPLCX9WhcW1G1BmEZ1tBnp/edit?mode=html)






    1.
    An upper room did our Lord prepare
    For those loved until the end:
    And His disciples still gather there,
    To celebrate their risen Friend.

    2.
    And after supper He washed their feet,
    For service, too, is sacrament.
    In Him our joy shall be made complete
    Sent out to serve, as He was sent.

    3.
    A lasting gift Jesus gave His own:
    To share His bread, His loving cup.
    Whatever burdens may bow us down,
    He by His cross shall lift us up.

    4.
    No end there is! we depart in peace.
    He loves beyond our uttermost:
    In every room in our Father’s house,
    He will be there, as Lord and host.
