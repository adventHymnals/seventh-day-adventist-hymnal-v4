    1.
    O for a heart to praise my God,
    A heart from sin set free,
    A heart that always feels Thy blood
    So freely shed for me.

    2.
    A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
    My dear Redeemer’s throne,
    Where only Christ is heard to speak,
    Where Jesus reigns alone.

    3.
    A heart in every thought renewed
    And full of love divine,
    Perfect and right and pure and good,
    A copy, Lord, of Thine.

    4.
    Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
    Come quickly from above;
    Write Thy new name upon my heart,
    Thy new, best name of Love.
