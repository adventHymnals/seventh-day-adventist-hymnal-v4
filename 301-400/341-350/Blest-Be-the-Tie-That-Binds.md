    1.
    Blest be the tie that binds
    our hearts in Christian love;
    the fellowship of kindred minds
    is like to that above.

    2.
    Before our Father’s throne
    we pour our ardent prayers;
    our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
    our comforts and our cares.

    3.
    We share each other’s woes,
    our mutual burdens bear;
    and often for each other flows
    the sympathizing tear.

    4.
    When we asunder part,
    it gives us inward pain;
    but we shall still be joined in heart,
    and hope to meet again.
