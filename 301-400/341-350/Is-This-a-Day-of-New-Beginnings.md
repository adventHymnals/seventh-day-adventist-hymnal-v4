    1.
    Is this a day of new beginnings,
    Time to remember and move on,
    Time too believe what love is bringing,
    Laying to rest the pain that’s gone?

    2.
    How can the seasons of a planet
    Mindlessly spinning round its sun
    With just a human name and number
    Say that some new thing has begun?

    3.
    Yet through the life and death of Jesus
    Love’s mighty Spirit, now as then,
    Can make for us a world of difference
    As faith and hope are born again.

    4.
    Then let us, with the Spirit’s daring,
    Step from the past and leave behind
    Its disappointment, guilt, and grieving,
    Seeking new paths, and sure to find.

    5.
    Christ is alive, and goes before us
    To show and share what love can do.
    This is a day of new beginnings;
    Our God is making all things new.
