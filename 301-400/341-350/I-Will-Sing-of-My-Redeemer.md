    1.
    I will sing of my Redeemer,
    And His wondrous love to me;
    On the cruel cross He suffered,
    From the curse to set me free.


    Refrain:
    Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
    With His blood, He purchased me.
    On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
    Paid the debt, and made me free.


    2.
    I will tell the wondrous story,
    How my lost estate to save,
    In His boundless love and mercy,
    He the ransom freely gave.


    Refrain:
    Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
    With His blood, He purchased me.
    On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
    Paid the debt, and made me free.

    3.
    I will sing of my Redeemer,
    And His heavenly love to me;
    He from death to life hath brought me,
    Son of God with Him to be.

    Refrain:
    Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
    With His blood, He purchased me.
    On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
    Paid the debt, and made me free.
