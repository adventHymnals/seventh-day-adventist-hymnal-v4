    1.
    Crowning jewel of creation,
    Blest and hallowed, sanctified;
    Time and changes all transcending,
    Shared forever, glorified.


    Refrain:
    Blessed Sabbath made for man,
    Gift from the Creator’s hand.


    2.
    Sin and sickness, prayer and weeping
    Cease at close of earthly days;
    But Thy Sabbath is eternal,
    Joyful thanks to Thee we raise!


    Refrain:
    Blessed Sabbath made for man,
    Gift from the Creator’s hand.

    3.
    Teach us Lord, in storm or sunshine
    How to truly rest in Thee,
    May Thy Sabbath peace enfold us
    And our shelter ever be.

    Refrain:
    Blessed Sabbath made for man,
    Gift from the Creator’s hand.
