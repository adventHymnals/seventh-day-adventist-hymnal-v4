    1.
    O day of rest and gladness,
    O day of joy and light,
    O balm of care and sadness,
    most beautiful, most bright;
    on thee, the high and lowly,
    who bend before throne,
    sing, “Holy, holy, holy,”
    to the Eternal One.

    2.
    Thou art a port protected
    from storms that round us rise;
    a garden intersected
    with streams of paradise;
    thou art a cooling fountain
    in life’s dry, dreary sand;
    from thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,
    we view our promised land.

    3.
    A day of sweet reflection,
    thou art a day of love,
    A day to raise affection
    from earth to things above.
    New graces ever gaining
    from this our day of rest,
    We reach the rest remaining
    in mansions of the blessed.

    1.
    O day of rest and gladness,
    O day of joy and light,
    O balm of care and sadness,
    Most beautiful, most bright,
    On thee the high and lowly
    Before th’ eternal throne
    Sing, “Holy, holy, holy,”
    To the great Three in One.

    2.
    Thou art a port protected
    From storms that round us rise;
    A garden intersected
    With streams of paradise;
    Thou art a cooling fountain
    In life’s dry dreary sand;
    From Thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,
    We view our promised land.

    3.
    A day of sweet reflection
    Thou art, a day of love,
    A day to raise affection
    From earth to things above.
    New graces ever gaining
    From this our day of rest,
    We seek the rest remaining
    To mansions of the blest.
