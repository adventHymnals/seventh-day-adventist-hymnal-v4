    1.
    Peace and healing on thy wing;
    And to every troubled breast
    Speak of the divine behest:
    Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!

    2.
    Earthly longings bid retire,
    Quench the passionsâ€™ hurtful fire;
    To the wayward, sin oppressed,
    Bring thou thy divine behest:
    Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!

    3.
    Wipe from every cheek the tear,
    Banish care and silence fear;
    All things working for the best,
    Teach us the divine behest:
    Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!
