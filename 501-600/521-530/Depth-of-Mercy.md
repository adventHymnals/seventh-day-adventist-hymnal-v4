    1.
    Depth of mercy!–can there be
    Mercy still reserved for me?
    Can my God His wrath forbear?
    Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

    2.
    I have long withstood His grace,
    Long provoked Him to His face,
    Would not hearken to His calls,
    Grieved Him by a thousand falls.

    3.
    Now incline me to repent;
    Let me now my sins lament;
    Now my foul revolt deplore,
    Weep, believe, and sin no more.

    4.
    There for me the Savior stands,
    Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;
    God is love! I know, I feel;
    Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
