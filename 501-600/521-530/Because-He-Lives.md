    1.
    God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,
    He came to love, heal, and forgive;
    He lived and died to buy my pardon,
    An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.


    Refrain:
    Because He lives I can face tomorrow,
    Because He lives all fear is gone;
    Because I know He holds the future.
    And life is worth the living just because He lives.


    2.
    How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
    And feel the pride, and joy He gives;
    But greater still the calm assurance,
    This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

    Refrain:
    Because He lives I can face tomorrow,
    Because He lives all fear is gone;
    Because I know He holds the future.
    And life is worth the living just because He lives.
