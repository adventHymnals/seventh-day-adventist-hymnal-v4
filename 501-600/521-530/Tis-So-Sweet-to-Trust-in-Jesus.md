    ‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
    and to take him at his word;
    just to rest upon his promise,
    and to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”


    Refrain:
    Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
    How I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!
    Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
    O for grace to trust him more!


    2.
    O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
    just to trust his cleansing blood;
    and in simple faith to plunge me
    neath the healing, cleansing flood!


    Refrain:
    Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
    How I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!
    Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
    O for grace to trust him more!

    3.
    Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
    just from sin and self to cease;
    just from Jesus simply taking
    life and rest, and joy and peace.


    Refrain:
    Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
    How I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!
    Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
    O for grace to trust him more!

    4.
    I’m so glad I learned to trust thee,
    precious Jesus, Savior, friend;
    and I know that thou art with me,
    wilt be with me to the end.

    Refrain:
    Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
    How I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!
    Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
    O for grace to trust him more!
