    1.
    My faith has found a resting place,
    Not in a manmade creed;
    I trust the ever living One,
    That He for me shall plead.


    Refrain:
    I need no other evidence,
    I need no other plea;
    It is enough that Jesus died,
    And rose again for me.


    2.
    Enough for me that Jesus saves,
    This ends my fear and doubt;
    A sinful soul, I come to Him,
    He will not cast me out.


    Refrain:
    I need no other evidence,
    I need no other plea;
    It is enough that Jesus died,
    And rose again for me.

    3.
    My soul is resting on the Word,
    The living Word of God,
    Salvation in my Saviorâ€™s name,
    Salvation through His blood.


    Refrain:
    I need no other evidence,
    I need no other plea;
    It is enough that Jesus died,
    And rose again for me.

    4.
    My great Physician heals the sick,
    The lost He came to save;
    For me His precious blood He shed,
    For me His life He gave.

    Refrain:
    I need no other evidence,
    I need no other plea;
    It is enough that Jesus died,
    And rose again for me.
