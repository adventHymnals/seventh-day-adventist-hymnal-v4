    1.
    Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
    Look upon a little child;
    Pity my simplicity,
    Suffer me to come to Thee.

    2.
    Lamb of God, I look to Thee;
    Thou shalt my example be;
    Thou art gentle, meek, and mild,
    Thou wast once a little child.

    3.
    Fain I would be as Thou art;
    Give me Thy obedient heart;
    Thou art pitiful and kind,
    Let me have Thy loving mind.

    4.
    I shall then show forth Thy praise,
    Serve Thee all my happy days;
    Then the world shall always see
    Christ, the Holy Child, in me.
