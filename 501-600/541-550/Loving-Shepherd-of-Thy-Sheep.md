    1.
    Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep,
    Keep Thy lamb, in safety keep;
    Nothing can Thy power withstand;
    None can pluck me from Thy hand.

    2.
    Loving Shepherd, ever near,
    Teach Thy lamb Thy voice to hear;
    Suffer not my steps to stray
    From the straight and narrow way.

    3.
    Where Thou leadest I would go,
    Walking in Thy steps below,
    Till within the heavenly fold
    I my Shepherd shall behold.
