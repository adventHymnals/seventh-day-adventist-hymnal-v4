    1.
    Jesus, Friend of little children,
    Be a friend to me;
    Take my hand and ever keep me
    Close to Thee.

    2.
    Teach me how to grow in goodness,
    Daily as I grow;
    Thou hast been a child, and surely
    Thou dost know.

    3.
    Step by step, O, lead me onward,
    Upward into youth;
    Wiser, stronger, still becoming
    In Thy truth.

    4.
    Never leave me, nor forsake me;
    Ever be my friend;
    For I need Thee from life’s dawning
    To its end.
