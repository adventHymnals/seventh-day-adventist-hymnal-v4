    1.
    Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
    in living echoes of thy tone;
    as thou has sought, so let me seek
    thine erring children lost and lone.

    2.
    O lead me, Lord, that I may lead
    the wandering and the wavering feet;
    O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
    thy hungering ones with manna sweet.

    3.
    O strengthen me, that while I stand
    firm on the rock, and strong in thee,
    I may stretch out a loving land
    to wrestlers with the troubled sea.
