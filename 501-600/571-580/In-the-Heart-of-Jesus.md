    1.
    In the heart of Jesus there is love for you,
    Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;
    Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,
    When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?

    2.
    In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you,
    Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;
    Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,
    Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought?

    3.
    In the field of Jesus there is work for you;
    Such as even angels might rejoice to do;
    Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand,
    While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?

    4.
    In the home of Jesus there’s a place for you;
    Glorious, bright, and joyous, calm and peaceful too;
    Why then, like a wanderer, roam with weary pace,
    If the home of Jesus holds for you a place?
