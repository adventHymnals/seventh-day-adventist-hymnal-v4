    1.
    Sweet promise is given to all who believe–
    “Behold I come quickly, Mine own to receive;
    Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;
    Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait.”


    Refrain:
    “Hold fast till I come,” sweet promise of heaven–
    “The kingdom restored, to you shall be given.”
    “Come, enter My joy, sit down on the throne;
    Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come.”


    2.
    We’ll “watch unto prayer” with lamps burning bright;
    He comes to all others a “thief in the night.”
    We know He is near, but know not the day–
    As spring shows that summer is not far away.


    Refrain:
    “Hold fast till I come,” sweet promise of heaven–
    “The kingdom restored, to you shall be given.”
    “Come, enter My joy, sit down on the throne;
    Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come.”

    3.
    Yes! this is our hope, ’tis built on His word–
    The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;
    Of promises all, it stands as the sum:
    “Behold I come quickly; hold fast till I come.”

    Refrain:
    “Hold fast till I come,” sweet promise of heaven–
    “The kingdom restored, to you shall be given.”
    “Come, enter My joy, sit down on the throne;
    Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come.”
