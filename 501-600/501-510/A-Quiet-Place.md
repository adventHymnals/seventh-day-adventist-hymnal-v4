    1.
    There is a quiet place,
    Far from the rapid pace where God can soothe my troubled mind.
    Sheltered by tree and flowâ€™r,
    There in my quiet hour with Him my cares are left behind.
    Whether a garden small,
    Or on a mountain tall,
    New strength and courage there I find;
    Then from this quiet place
    I go prepared to face a new day
    With love for all mankind.
