    1.
    Jesus, guide our way
    To eternal day:
    So shall we, no more delaying,
    Follow Thee, Thy voice obeying:
    Lead us by the hand
    To our Father’s land.

    2.
    When we danger meet
    Steadfast make our feet;
    Lord, preserve us uncomplaining
    Mid the darkness round us reigning:
    Through adversity lies our way to Thee.

    3.
    Order all our way
    Through the mortal day:
    In our toil, with aid be near us:
    In our need, with succour cheer us:
    Till we safely stand
    In our Father’s land.
