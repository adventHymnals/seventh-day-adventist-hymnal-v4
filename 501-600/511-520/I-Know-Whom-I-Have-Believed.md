    1.
    I know not why God’s wondrous grace To me He hath made known,
    Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love Redeemed me for His own.


    Refrain:
    But “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that His is able
    To keep that which I’ve committed Unto Him against that day.”


    2.
    I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart,
    Nor how believing in His word Wrought peace within my heart.


    Refrain:
    But “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that His is able
    To keep that which I’ve committed Unto Him against that day.”

    3.
    I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing men of sin,
    Revealing Jesus through the word, Creating faith in Him.


    Refrain:
    But “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that His is able
    To keep that which I’ve committed Unto Him against that day.”

    4.
    I know not when my Lord may come, At night or noonday fair,
    Nor if I walk the vale with Him, Or meet Him in the air.

    Refrain:
    But “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that His is able
    To keep that which I’ve committed Unto Him against that day.”
