    1.
    Give to the winds your fears;
    In hope be undismayed:
    God hears your sighs and coundts your tears,
    God shall lift up your head.

    2.
    To Him commit your griefs;
    Your ways put in His hands
    To His sure truth adn tender care
    Who earth adn heave commands.

    3.
    O put your trust in God;
    In duty’s path go on.
    Walk in His strength with faith and hope,
    So shall your work be done.

    4.
    Leave to His sovereign sway
    To choose and to command;
    So you shall, faithful, seek His way
    how wise, how strong His hand!
