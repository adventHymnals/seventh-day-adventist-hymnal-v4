    1.
    In heavenly love abiding, No change my heart shall fear;
    And safe is such confiding, For nothing changes here.
    The storm may roar without me, My heart may low be laid;
    But God is round about me, And can I be dismayed?

    2.
    Wherever He may guide me, No want shall turn me back;
    My Shepherd is besided me, And nothing can I lack.
    His wisdom ever waketh, His sight is never dim;
    He knows the way He taketh, And I will walk with Him.

    3.
    Green pastures are before me, Which yet I have not seen;
    Bright skies will soon be oâ€™er me, Where darkest clouds have been.
    My hope I cannot measure, My path to life is free;
    My Savior has my teasure, And He will walk with me.
