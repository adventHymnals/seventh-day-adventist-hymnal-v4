    1.
    Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
    hear my humble cry;
    while on others thou art calling,
    do not pass me by.


    Refrain:
    Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
    while on others thou art calling,
    do not pass me by.


    2.
    Let me at thy throne of mercy
    find a sweet relief,
    kneeling there in deep contrition;
    help my unbelief.


    Refrain:
    Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
    while on others thou art calling,
    do not pass me by.

    3.
    Trusting only in thy merit,
    would I seek thy face;
    heal my wounded, broken spirit,
    save me by thy grace.


    Refrain:
    Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
    while on others thou art calling,
    do not pass me by.

    4.
    Thou the spring of all my comfort,
    more than life to me,
    whom have I on earth beside thee?
    Whom in heaven but thee?

    Refrain:
    Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
    while on others thou art calling,
    do not pass me by.
