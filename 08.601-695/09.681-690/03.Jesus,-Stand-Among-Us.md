## 683. JESUS, STAND AMONG US
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Jesus, stand among us
In Thy risen power;
Let this time of worship
Be a hallowed hour.

2.
Breathe the Holy Spirit
Into every heart;
Bid the fears and sorrows
From each soul depart.

3.
Thus with quickened footsteps
We pursue our way,
Watching for the dawning
Of eternal day.
