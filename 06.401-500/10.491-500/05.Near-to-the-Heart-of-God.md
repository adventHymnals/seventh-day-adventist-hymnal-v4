1.
There is a place of quiet rest,
near to the heart of God;
a place where sin cannot molest,
near to the heart of God.


Refrain:
O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
sent from the heart of God,
hold us who wait before thee
near to the heart of God.


2.
There is a place of comfort sweet,
near to the heart of God;
a place where we our Savior meet,
near to the heart of God.


Refrain:
O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
sent from the heart of God,
hold us who wait before thee
near to the heart of God.

3.
There is place a place of full release,
near to the heart of God;
a place where all is joy and peace,
near to the heart of God.

Refrain:
O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
sent from the heart of God,
hold us who wait before thee
near to the heart of God.
