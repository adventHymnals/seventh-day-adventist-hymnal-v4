## 420. JERUSALEM, MY HAPPY HOME
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Jerusalem, my happy home,
O how I long for thee!
When will my sorrows have an end,
The joys when shall I see?

2.
The walls are all of precious stone,
Most glorious to behold;
Thy gates are richly set with pearl,
Thy streets are paved with gold.

3.
Thy garden and thy pleasant walks
My study long have been;
Such dazzling views by human sight
Have never yet been seen.

4.
Lord, help us by Thy mighty grace,
To keep in view the prize,
Till Thou dost come to take us home
To that blessed paradise.
