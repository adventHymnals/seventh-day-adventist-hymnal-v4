      SDAH 460. As Water to the Thirsty. 1. As water to the thirsty, As beauty to the eyes, As strength that follows weakness, As truth instead of lies; As song-time and springtime and summertime to be, So is my Lord, my living Lord, So is my Lord to me.

## 460. AS WATER TO THE THIRSTY
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
As water to the thirsty,
As beauty to the eyes,
As strength that follows weakness,
As truth instead of lies;
As song-time and springtime and summertime to be,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.

2.
Like calm in place of clamor
Like peace that follows pain,
Like meeting after parting,
Like sunshine after rain;
Like moonlight and starlight and sunlight on the sea,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.

3.
As sleep that follows fever,
As gold instead of grey,
As freedom after bondage,
As sunrise to the day;
As home to the travâ€™ler and all he longs to see,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.
