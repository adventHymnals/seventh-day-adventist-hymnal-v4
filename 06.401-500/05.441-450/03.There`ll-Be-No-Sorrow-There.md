1.
There’ll be no night in heaven,
In that blest world above;
No anxious toil, no weary hours;
For labor there is love.


Refrain:
There’ll be no sorrow there,
There’ll be no sorrow there;
In heaven above, where all is love,
There’ll be no sorrow there.


2.
There’ll be no grief in heaven;
For life is one glad day,
And tears are those of former things
Which all have passed away.


Refrain:
There’ll be no sorrow there,
There’ll be no sorrow there;
In heaven above, where all is love,
There’ll be no sorrow there.

3.
There’ll be no sin in heaven;
Behold that blessed throng,
All holy in there spotless robes,
All holy in their song.

Refrain:
There’ll be no sorrow there,
There’ll be no sorrow there;
In heaven above, where all is love,
There’ll be no sorrow there.
