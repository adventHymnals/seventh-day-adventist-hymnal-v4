## 409. JESUS INVITES HIS SAINTS
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Jesus invites His saints
To meet around His board,
And sup in memory of the death
And sufferings of their Lord.

2.
We take the bread and wine
As emblems of Thy death;
Lord, raise our souls above the sign,
To feast on Thee by faith.

2.
Faith eats the bread of life,
And drinks the living wine;
It looks beyond this scene of strife
Unites us to the Vine.

4.
Soon shall the night be gone,
Our Lord will come again;
The marriage supper of the Lamb
Will usher in His reign.
