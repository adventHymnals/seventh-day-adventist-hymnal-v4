## 402. BY CHRIST REDEEMED
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
By Christ redeemed, In Christ restored,
We keep the memory adored,
And show the death of our dear Lord,
Until He come.

2.
His broken body in our stead is here,
In his memorial bread;
And so our feeble love is fed,
Until He come.

3.
His fearful drops of agony,
His lifeblood shed for us we see;
The wine shall tell the mystery,
Until He come.

4.
And thus that dark betrayal night,
With the last advent we unite
The shame, the glory, by this rite,
Until He come.
