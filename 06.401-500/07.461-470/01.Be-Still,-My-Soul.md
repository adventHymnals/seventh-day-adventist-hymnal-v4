#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Be still, my soul:
the Lord is on thy side;
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In every change He faithful will remain.


Refrain:
Be still, my soul:
thy best, thy heavenly friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.


2.
Be still, my soul:
thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.


Refrain:
Be still, my soul:
thy best, thy heavenly friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

3.
Be still, my soul:
the hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, loveâ€™s purest joys restored.

Refrain:
Be still, my soul:
thy best, thy heavenly friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.
