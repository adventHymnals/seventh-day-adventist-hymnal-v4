```txt



1.
When I can read my title clear
To mansions in the skies
I’ll bid farewell to every fear,
And wipe my weeping eyes;
And wipe my weeping eyes,
And wipe my weeping eyes,
I’ll bid farewell to every fear,
And wipe my weeping eyes.

2.
Should earth against my soul engage,
And fiery darts be hurled,
Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,
And face a frowning world;
And face a frowning world,
And face a frowning world,
Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,
And face a frowning world.
