    1.
    Each little flowâ€™r that opens
    Each little bird that sings
    He made their glowing colours
    He made their tiny wings.

    2.
    The purple-headed mountain
    The river running by
    The sunset and the morning
    That brighten up the sky.

    3.
    The cold wind in the winter
    The pleasant summer sun
    The ripe fruits in the garden
    He made them, every one.

    4.
    He gave us eyes to see them
    And lips that we might tell
    How great is God Almighty
    Who has made all things well.
