    1.
    God be with you till we meet again;
    By His counsels guide, uphold you,
    With His sheep securely fold you:
    God be with you till we meet again.

    2.
    God be with you till we meet again;
    Neath His wings securely hide you,
    Daily manna still provide you:
    God be with you till we meet again.

    3.
    God be with you till we meet again;
    When life’s perils thick confound you,
    Put His arms unfailing round you:
    God be with you till we meet again.

    4.
    God be with you till we meet again;
    Keep love’s banner floating o’er you,
    Smite death’s threatening wave before you:
    God be with you till we meet again.
