    1.
    Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing;
    fill our hearts with joy and peace;
    let us each, thy love possessing,
    triumph in redeeming grace.
    O refresh us, O refresh us,
    traveling through this wilderness.

    2.
    Thanks we give and adoration
    for thy gospelâ€™s joyful sound.
    May the fruits of thy salvation
    in our hearts and lives abound;
    ever faithful, ever faithful
    to the truth may we be found.
