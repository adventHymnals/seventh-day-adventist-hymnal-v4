    1.
    O Lord, now let Your servant
    Depart in heav’nly peace,
    For I have seen the glory
    Of Your redeeming grace:
    A light to lead the Gentiles
    Unto Your holy hill,
    The glory of Your people,
    Your chosen Israel.

    2.
    Then grant that I may follow Your gleam,
    O glorious Light,
    Till earthly shadows scatter,
    And faith is changed to sight;
    Till raptured saints shall gather
    Upon that shining shore,
    Where Christ, the blessed Day star,
    Shall light them evermore.
