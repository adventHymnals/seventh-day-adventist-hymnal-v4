    1.
    Now the day is over,
    night is drawing nigh,
    Shadows of the evening
    steal across the sky.

    2.
    Father, give the weary,
    calm and sweet repose;
    With Thy tenderest blessing
    May our eyelids close.

    3.
    Through the long night watches,
    may thine angels spread
    Their white wings above me,
    watching round my bed.
