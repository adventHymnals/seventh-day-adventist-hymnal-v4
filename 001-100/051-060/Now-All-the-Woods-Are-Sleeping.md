    1.
    Now all the woods are sleeping,
    And night and stillness creeping
    O’er city, man, and beast;
    But thou, my heart, awake thee,
    To pray’r awhile be take thee,
    And praise thy Maker ere thou rest.

    2.
    My Jesus, stay Thou by me,
    And let no foe come nigh me,
    Safe sheltered by Thy wing;
    But would the foe alarm me,
    O let him never harm me,
    But still Thine angels round me sing!

    3.
    My loved ones, rest securely,
    From every peril surely
    Our God will guard your heads;
    And happy slumbers send you,
    And bid His hosts attend you,
    And golden armed watch o’er your beds.
