    1.
    Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
    The day is past and gone;
    The shadows of the evening fall;
    The night is coming on!
    Within my heart a welcome guest,
    Within my home abide;


    Refrain:
    O Savior, stay this night with me;
    Behold, ’tis eventide!
    O Savior, stay this night with me;
    Behold, ’tis eventide.


    2.
    Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
    Thy walk today with me
    Has made my heart within me burn,
    As I communed with Thee.
    Thy earnest words have filled my soul
    And kept me near Thy side;


    Refrain:
    O Savior, stay this night with me;
    Behold, ’tis eventide!
    O Savior, stay this night with me;
    Behold, ’tis eventide.

    3.
    Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
    And lone will be the night,
    If I cannot commune with Thee,
    Nor find in Thee my light.
    The darkness of the world, I fear,
    Would in my home abide;

    Refrain:
    O Savior, stay this night with me;
    Behold, ’tis eventide!
    O Savior, stay this night with me;
    Behold, ’tis eventide.
