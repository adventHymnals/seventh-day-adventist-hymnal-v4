    1.
    O Lord my God
    When I in awesome wonder
    Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made
    I see the stars
    I hear the rolling thunder
    Thy power throughout the universe displayed


    Refrain:
    Then sings my soul
    My Saviour God to Thee
    How great Thou art
    How great Thou art
    Then sings my soul
    My Saviour God to Thee
    How great Thou art
    How great Thou art


    2.
    When through the woods
    And forest glades I wander
    And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
    When I look down
    From lofty mountain grandeur
    And see the brook and feel the gentle breeze


    Refrain:
    Then sings my soul
    My Saviour God to Thee
    How great Thou art
    How great Thou art
    Then sings my soul
    My Saviour God to Thee
    How great Thou art
    How great Thou art

    3.
    And when I think
    That God His Son not sparing
    Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in
    That on the Cross
    My burden gladly bearing
    He bled and died to take away my sin.


    Refrain:
    Then sings my soul
    My Saviour God to Thee
    How great Thou art
    How great Thou art
    Then sings my soul
    My Saviour God to Thee
    How great Thou art
    How great Thou art

    4.
    When Christ shall come
    With shouts of acclamation
    And take me home
    What joy shall fill my heart
    Then I shall bow
    In humble adoration
    And then proclaim
    “My God, how great Thou art!”

    Refrain:
    Then sings my soul
    My Saviour God to Thee
    How great Thou art
    How great Thou art
    Then sings my soul
    My Saviour God to Thee
    How great Thou art
    How great Thou art
