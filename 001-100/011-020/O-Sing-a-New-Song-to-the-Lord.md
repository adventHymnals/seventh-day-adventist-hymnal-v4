    1.
    O sing a new song to the Lord
    For marvels He has done;
    His right hand and His holy arm
    The victory have won.

    2.
    With harp, and voice of psalms
    Unto Jehovah sing;
    Let trumpets and the echoing horn
    Acclaim the Lord our King!

    3.
    Let seas with all their creatures roar,
    The world and dwellers there,
    And let the rivers clap their hands,
    The hills their joy declare.

    4.
    Before the Lord: because He comes,
    To judge the earth come He;
    He’ll judge the world
    with righteousness,
    His folk with equity.
