    1.
    Every star shall sing a carol;
    Every creatures, high or low,
    Come and praise the King of heaven
    By whatever name you know.
    God above, Man below,
    Holy is the name I know.

    2.
    When the King of all creation
    Had a cradle on the earth,
    Holy was the human body,
    Holy was the human birth.
    God above, Man below,
    Holy is the name I know.

    3.
    Every star and every planet,
    Every creature, high or low,
    Come and praise the King of heaven
    By whatever name you know.
    God above, Man below,
    Holy is the name I know.
