    1.
    Come, Christians, join to sing,
    Alleluia! Amen!
    Loud praise to Christ our King;
    Alleluia! Amen!
    Let all, with heart and voice,
    Before His throne rejoice;
    Praise is His gracious choice:
    Alleluia! Amen!

    2.
    Come, lift your hearts on high;
    Alleluia! Amen!
    Let praises fill the sky;
    Alleluia! Amen!
    He is our Guide and Friend;
    To us He’ll condescend;
    His love shall never end:
    Alleluia! Amen!

    3.
    Praise yet our Christ again;
    Alleluia! Amen!
    Life shall not end the strain;
    Alleluia! Amen!
    On heaven’s blissful shore
    His goodness we’ll adore,
    Singing forevermore,
    Alleluia! Amen!
