    1.
    Come let us sing of homeland,
    Down by the crystal sea;
    Wonderful land where Jesus
    Buildeth a mansion for me.


    Refrain:
    Over yonder, down by the crystal sea,
    down              by the crystal sea,
    Over yonder, there’s where I long to be,
    There’s            where I long to be,
    No more sorrow, toil, grief, nor care,
    In the homeland bright and fair,
    Over, over there.
    Over there.


    2.
    Water of life there floweth,
    Fruit in abundant store;
    Citizens of that country
    Hunger and thirst never more.


    Refrain:
    Over yonder, down by the crystal sea,
    down              by the crystal sea,
    Over yonder, there’s where I long to be,
    There’s            where I long to be,
    No more sorrow, toil, grief, nor care,
    In the homeland bright and fair,
    Over, over there.
    Over there.

    3.
    Come go with me to homeland,
    Jesus invites you there;
    Help spread the invitation,
    Tell it to men everywhere.

    Refrain:
    Over yonder, down by the crystal sea,
    down              by the crystal sea,
    Over yonder, there’s where I long to be,
    There’s            where I long to be,
    No more sorrow, toil, grief, nor care,
    In the homeland bright and fair,
    Over, over there.
    Over there.
