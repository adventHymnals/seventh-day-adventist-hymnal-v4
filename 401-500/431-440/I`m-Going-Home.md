    1.
    My heav’nly home is bright and fair,
    Nor pain nor death can enter there;
    It’s glitt’ring tow’rs the sun outshine,
    That heav’nly mansion shall me mine.


    Refrain:
    I’m going home, I’m going home,
    I’m going home to die no more;
    To die no more; to die no more-
    I’m going home to die no more.


    2.
    My Father’s house is built on high,
    Far, far above the starry sky;
    When from this earthly prison free,
    That heav’nly mansion mine shall be.


    Refrain:
    I’m going home, I’m going home,
    I’m going home to die no more;
    To die no more; to die no more-
    I’m going home to die no more.

    3.
    Let others seek a home below,
    Which flames devour or waves oe’r flow;
    Be mine a happier lot to own
    A heav’nly mansion near the throne.

    Refrain:
    I’m going home, I’m going home,
    I’m going home to die no more;
    To die no more; to die no more-
    I’m going home to die no more.
