    1.
    O God, unseen, yet ever near,
    Reveal Thy presence now
    While we in love that hath no fear,
    Before Thy glory bow.

    2.
    Here may Thy faithful people know
    The blessings of Thy love,
    The streams that thro’ the dessert flow,
    The manna from above.

    3.
    We come, obedient to Thy Word
    To feast on heav’nly food,
    Our meat, the body of our Lord,
    Our drink, His precious blood.

    4.
    Thus may we all Thy words obey,
    For we, O God, are Thine,
