    1.
    Love consecrates the humblest act
    And haloes mercy’s deeds;
    It sheds a benediction sweet
    And hallows human needs.

    2.
    When in the shadow of the cross
    Christ knelt and washed the feet
    Of His disciples, He gave us
    A sign of love complete.

    3.
    Love serves and willing, stoops to serve;
    What Christ in love so true
    Has freely done for one and all,
    Let us now gladly do!
