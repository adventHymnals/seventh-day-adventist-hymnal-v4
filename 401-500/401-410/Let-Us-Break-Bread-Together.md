    1.
    Let us break bread together on our knees,
    let us break bread together on our knees.
    When I fall on my knees with my face to the rising sun,
    O Lord, have mercy on me.

    2.
    Let us drink wine together on our knees,
    let us drink wine together on our knees.
    When I fall on my knees with my face to the rising sun,
    O Lord, have mercy on me.

    3.
    Let us praise God together on our knees,
    let us praise God together on our knees.
    When I fall on my knees with my face to the rising sun,
    O Lord, have mercy on me.
