    1.
    In imitation, Lord, of Thee,
    This solemn service we repeat;
    For Thine example full of grace,
    Has made this humble duty sweet.

    2.
    Renew each sacred spark of love,
    And vitalize the holy flame;
    May union strong our hearts unite
    While this we do in Jesus’ name.

    3.
    Our great example Thou shalt be,
    In washing Thy disciples feet;
    And as we follow Thy command,
    Make Thou our fellowship complete.
