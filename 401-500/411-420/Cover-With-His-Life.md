    1.
    Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;
    Father, impute His life unto me.
    My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow.


    Refrain:
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow;
    Fullness of His life then shall I know;
    My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
    Cover with His life, whither than snow.


    2.
    Deep are the wounds transgression has made;
    Red are the stains; my soul is afraid.
    O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,
    Safe from the law that now judgeth me!


    Refrain:
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow;
    Fullness of His life then shall I know;
    My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
    Cover with His life, whither than snow.

    3.
    Longing the joy of pardon to know;
    Jesus holds out a robe white as snow;
    “Lord, I accept it! Leaving my own,
    Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone.”


    Refrain:
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow;
    Fullness of His life then shall I know;
    My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
    Cover with His life, whither than snow.

    4.
    Reconciled by His death for my sin,
    Justified by His life pure and clean,
    Sanctified by obeying His word,
    Glorified when returneth my Lord.

    Refrain:
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow;
    Fullness of His life then shall I know;
    My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
    Cover with His life, whither than snow.
