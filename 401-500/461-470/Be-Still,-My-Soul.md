    1.
    Be still, my soul:
    the Lord is on thy side;
    Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;
    Leave to thy God to order and provide;
    In every change He faithful will remain.


    Refrain:
    Be still, my soul:
    thy best, thy heavenly friend
    Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.


    2.
    Be still, my soul:
    thy God doth undertake
    To guide the future as He has the past.
    Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
    All now mysterious shall be bright at last.


    Refrain:
    Be still, my soul:
    thy best, thy heavenly friend
    Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

    3.
    Be still, my soul:
    the hour is hastening on
    When we shall be forever with the Lord,
    When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
    Sorrow forgot, loveâ€™s purest joys restored.

    Refrain:
    Be still, my soul:
    thy best, thy heavenly friend
    Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.
