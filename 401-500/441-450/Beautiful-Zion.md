    1.
    Beautiful Zion, built above,
    Beautiful city that I love,
    Beautiful gates of pearly white,
    Beautiful temple, God its light.

    2.
    Beautiful trees forever there,
    Beautiful fruit they always bear,
    Beautiful rivers gliding by,
    Beautiful fountains never dry.

    3.
    Beautiful crowns on every brow,
    Beautiful palms the conquerors show,
    Beautiful robes the ransomed wear,
    Beautiful all who enter there.
