    1.
    I’m but a stranger here,
    Heav’n is my home;
    Earth is a desert drear,
    Heav’n is my home.
    Danger and sorrow stand
    Round me on every hand;
    Heav’n is my fatherland,
    Heav’n is my home.

    2.
    What though the tempest rage,
    Heav’n is my home;
    Short is my pilgrimage,
    Heav’n is my home;
    And time’s wild wintry blast
    Soon shall be over past;
    I shall reach home at last,
    Heav’n is my home.

    3.
    There at my Savior’s side
    Heav’n is my home;
    I shall be glorified,
    Heav’n is my home;
    There are the good and blest,
    Those I love most and best;
    And there I, too, shall rest,
    Heav’n is my home.
