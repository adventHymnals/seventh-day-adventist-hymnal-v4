    1.
    There’ll be no night in heaven,
    In that blest world above;
    No anxious toil, no weary hours;
    For labor there is love.


    Refrain:
    There’ll be no sorrow there,
    There’ll be no sorrow there;
    In heaven above, where all is love,
    There’ll be no sorrow there.


    2.
    There’ll be no grief in heaven;
    For life is one glad day,
    And tears are those of former things
    Which all have passed away.


    Refrain:
    There’ll be no sorrow there,
    There’ll be no sorrow there;
    In heaven above, where all is love,
    There’ll be no sorrow there.

    3.
    There’ll be no sin in heaven;
    Behold that blessed throng,
    All holy in there spotless robes,
    All holy in their song.

    Refrain:
    There’ll be no sorrow there,
    There’ll be no sorrow there;
    In heaven above, where all is love,
    There’ll be no sorrow there.
