    1.
    I’m a pilgrim, and I’m a stranger;
    I can tarry, I can tarry but a night;
    Do not detain me, for I am going
    To where the fountains are ever flowing.


    Refrain:
    I’m a pilgrim, and I’m a stranger;
    I can tarry, I can tarry but a night.


    2.
    There the glory is ever shining!
    O, my longing heart, my longing heart is there;
    Here in this country so dark and dreary,
    I long have wandered forlorn and weary.


    Refrain:
    I’m a pilgrim, and I’m a stranger;
    I can tarry, I can tarry but a night.

    3.
    There’s the city to which I journey;
    My Redeemer, my Redeemer is its light!
    There is no sorrow, nor any sighing,
    Nor any tears there, or any dying.

    Refrain:
    I’m a pilgrim, and I’m a stranger;
    I can tarry, I can tarry but a night.
