    1.
    Don’t you see my Jesus coming,
    See Him come in yonder cloud?
    With ten thousand angels round Him,
    How they do my Jesus crowd!


    Refrain:
    I am bound for the kingdom,
    Will you go to glory with me?
    Hallelujah! O praise ye the Lord!


    2.
    Don’t you see the saints ascending,
    Hear them shouting thro’ the air.
    Jesus smiling, trumpets sounding,
    Now His glory they shall share.

    Refrain:
    I am bound for the kingdom,
    Will you go to glory with me?
    Hallelujah! O praise ye the Lord!
