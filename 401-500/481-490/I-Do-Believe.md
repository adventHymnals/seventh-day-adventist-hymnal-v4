    1.
    Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;
    No other help I know;
    If Thou withdraw Thyself from me,
    Ah, wither shall I go?

    2.
    On Thy dear Son I now believe,
    O let me feel Thy power;
    And all my varied wants relieve,
    In this accepted hour.

    3.
    Author of faith! To Thee I lift
    My weary, longing eyes;
    O let me now receive that gift;
    My soul without it dies.

    4.
    Surely Thou canst not let me die;
    O speak, and I shall live;
    And here I will unwearied lie,
    Till Thou Thy Spirit give.

    5.
    How would my fainting soul rejoice
    Could I but see Thy face!
    Now let me hear Thy quickening voice,
    And taste Thy pardoning grace.

    6.
    I do believe, I now believe
    That Jesus died for me,
    And that He shed His precious blood
    From sin to set me free.
