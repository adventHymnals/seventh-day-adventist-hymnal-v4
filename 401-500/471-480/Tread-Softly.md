    1.
    Be silent, be silent, A whisper is heard;
    Be silent, and listen, Oh treasure each word.


    Refrain:
    Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;
    Tread softly here, tread softly here,
    Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.
    Tread softly here, tread softly here,


    2.
    Be silent, be silent, For holy this place,
    This altar that echoes The message of grace.


    Refrain:
    Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;
    Tread softly here, tread softly here,
    Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.
    Tread softly here, tread softly here,

    3.
    Be silent, be silent, Breathe humbly our prayer;
    A foretaste of Eden This moment we share.


    Refrain:
    Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;
    Tread softly here, tread softly here,
    Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.
    Tread softly here, tread softly here,

    4.
    Be silent, be silent, His mercy record;
    Be silent, be silent, And wait on the Lord.

    Refrain:
    Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;
    Tread softly here, tread softly here,
    Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.
    Tread softly here, tread softly here,
