    1.
    Days are filled with sorrow and care,
    Hearts are lonely and drear;
    Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
    Jesus is very near.


    Refrain:
    Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
    Calvary, Calvary,
    Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
    Jesus is very near.


    2.
    Cast your care on Jesus today,
    Leave your worry and fear;
    Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
    Jesus is very near.


    Refrain:
    Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
    Calvary, Calvary,
    Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
    Jesus is very near.

    3.
    Troubled soul, the Saviour can see,
    Evâ€™ry heartache and tear;
    Burdens are lifted at Calvary
    Jesus is very near.

    Refrain:
    Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
    Calvary, Calvary,
    Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
    Jesus is very near.
