    1.
    Come, we that love the Lord,
    And let our joys be known;
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    And thus surround the throne,
    And thus surround the throne.


    Refrain:
    We’re marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
    We’re marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.


    2.
    Let those refuse to sing
    Who never knew our God;
    But children of the heav’nly King,
    But children of the heav’nly King
    May speak their joys abroad,
    May speak their joys abroad.


    Refrain:
    We’re marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
    We’re marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.

    3.
    The hill of Zion yields
    A thousand sacred sweets
    Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
    Before we reach the heav’nly fields
    Or walk the golden streets,
    Or walk the golden streets.


    Refrain:
    We’re marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
    We’re marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.

    4.
    Then let our songs abound
    And ev’ry tear be dry;
    We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground,
    We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground
    To fairer worlds on high,
    To fairer worlds on high.

    Refrain:
    We’re marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
    We’re marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.
