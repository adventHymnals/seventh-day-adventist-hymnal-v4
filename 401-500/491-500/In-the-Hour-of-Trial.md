    1.
    In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
    Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
    When Thou seeâ€™st me waver, with a look recall,
    Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.

    2.
    With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm;
    Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;
    Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,
    Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.

    3.
    Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil, and woe,
    Or should pain attend me on my path below,
    Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see;
    Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.
