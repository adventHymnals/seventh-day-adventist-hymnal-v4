    1.
    Like the woman at the well I was seeking
    For things that could not satisfy:
    And then I heard my Savior speaking:
    ” Draw from my well that never shall run dry”.


    Refrain:
    Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
    Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
    Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more–
    Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!


    2.
    There are millions in this world who are craving
    The pleasures earthly things afford;
    But none can match the wondrous treasure
    That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.


    Refrain:
    Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
    Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
    Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more–
    Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!

    3.
    So, my brother, if the things this world gave you
    Leave hungers that won’t pass away,
    My blessed Lord will come and save you,
    If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:

    Refrain:
    Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
    Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
    Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more–
    Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
