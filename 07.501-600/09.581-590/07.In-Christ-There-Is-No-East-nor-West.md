#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
In Christ there is no east nor west,
In Him no south or north;
But one great fellowship of love
Throughout the whole wide earth.

2.
In Him shall true heart everywhere
Their high communion find;
His service is the golden cord
Close binding all mankind.

3.
Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,
Whateâ€™er your race may be.
Who serves my Father as a son
Is surely kin to me.

4.
In Christ now meet both east and west,
In Him meet south and north;
All Christly souls are one in Him
Throughout the whole wide earth.
