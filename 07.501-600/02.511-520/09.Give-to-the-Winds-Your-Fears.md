## 519. GIVE TO THE WINDS YOUR FEARS
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Give to the winds your fears;
In hope be undismayed:
God hears your sighs and coundts your tears,
God shall lift up your head.

2.
To Him commit your griefs;
Your ways put in His hands
To His sure truth adn tender care
Who earth adn heave commands.

3.
O put your trust in God;
In dutyâ€™s path go on.
Walk in His strength with faith and hope,
So shall your work be done.

4.
Leave to His sovereign sway
To choose and to command;
So you shall, faithful, seek His way
how wise, how strong His hand!
