    1.
    Come, you faithful, raise the strain
    Of triumphant gladness;
    God has brought His people
    Now rejoice, Jerusalem,
    And with true affection
    Welcome in unwearied strains
    Jesus’resurrection.

    2.
    ‘Tis the spring of souls today;
    Christ has burst His prison
    From the frost and gloom of death
    light and life have risen
    All the winter of our sins,
    Long and dark, is flying
    From His ligth, to whom we give
    Thanks and praise undying.

    3.
    “Alleluia!” now we cry
    to our King immortal,
    Who, triumphant, burst the
    bars of the tomb’s dark portal
    “Alleluia!” with the Son,
    God the Father praising;
    “Alleluia!” yet again to
    the Spirit raising.

    1.
    Come, you faithful, raise the strain
    Of triumphant gladness;
    God has brought His Israel
    Into joy from sadness;
    Loosed from Pharoah’s bitter yoke
    Jacob’s sons and daughters;
    Led them with unmoistened foot
    Through the Red Sea waters.

    2.
    ‘Tis the spring of souls today;
    Christ has burst His prison,
    And from three days’sleep in death
    As a sun has risen;
    All the winter of our sins,
    Long and dark, is flying
    From His light, to whom is giv’n
    Laud and praise undying.

    3.
    Now the queen of seasons, bright
    With the day of splendor,
    With the royal feast of feasts,
    Comes its joy to render;
    Comes to gladden faithful hearts
    Which with true affection
    Welcome in unwearied strain
    Jesus’resurrection.

    4.
    For today among the twelve
    Christ appeared, be stowing
    His deep peace, which evermore
    Passes human knowing.
    Neither could the gates of death,
    Nor the tomb’s dark portal,
    Nor the watchers, nor the seal,
    Hold Him as a mortal.

    5.
    “Alleluia!” now we cry
    To our King immortal,
    Who, triumphant, burst the bars
    Of the tomb’s dark portal;
    “Alleluia” with the Son,
    God the Father praising;
    “Alleluia!” yet again
    To the Spirit raising.
