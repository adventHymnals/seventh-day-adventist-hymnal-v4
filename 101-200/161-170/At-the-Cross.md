    1.
    Alas! and did my Savior bleed,
    and did my Sovereign die?
    Would he devote that sacred head
    for sinners such as I?


    Refrain:
    At the cross, at the cross,
    where I first saw the light,
    and the burden of my heart rolled away;
    it was there by faith I received my sight,
    and now I am happy all the day!


    2.
    Was it for crimes that I have done,
    he groaned upon the tree?
    Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
    And love beyond degree!


    Refrain:
    At the cross, at the cross,
    where I first saw the light,
    and the burden of my heart rolled away;
    it was there by faith I received my sight,
    and now I am happy all the day!

    3.
    But drops of grief can ne’er repay
    the debt of love I owe:
    Here, Lord, I give myself away;
    ’tis all that I can do!

    Refrain:
    At the cross, at the cross,
    where I first saw the light,
    and the burden of my heart rolled away;
    it was there by faith I received my sight,
    and now I am happy all the day!
