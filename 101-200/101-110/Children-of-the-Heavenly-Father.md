[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1XBHQZNrTFwpnDSjlSpAmkrBcKHUMb6/edit?mode=html)






    1.
    Children of the heavenly Father
    Safely in His bossom gather;
    Nestling bird nor star in heaven
    Such a refuge e’er was given.

    2.
    God His own doth tend and nourish,
    In His holy love they flourish;
    From all evil things He spares them,
    In His mighty arms He bears them.

    3.
    Neither life nor death shall ever
    From the Lord His children sever;
    Unto them His grace He showeth,
    And their sorrows all He knoweth.

    4.
    Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,
    Your Protector never slumbers;
    At the will of your Defender
    Every foe-man must surrender.

    5.
    Though He giveth or He taketh,
    God His children ne’er forsaketh;
    His the loving purpose solely
    To preserve them pure and holy.
