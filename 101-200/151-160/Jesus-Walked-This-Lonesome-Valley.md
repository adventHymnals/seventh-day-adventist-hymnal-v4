    1.
    Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
    He had to walk it by Himself.
    O nobody else could walk it for Him.
    He had to walk it by Himself.

    2.
    I must go and stand my trial.
    I have to stand it by myself.
    O nobody else could stand it for me.
    I have to stand it by myself.

    3.
    Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
    He had to walk it by Himself.
    O nobody else could walk it for Him.
    He had to walk it by Himself.
