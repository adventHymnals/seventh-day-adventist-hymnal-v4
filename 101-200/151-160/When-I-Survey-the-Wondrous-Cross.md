    1.
    When I survey the wondrous cross
    on which the Prince of Glory died;
    my richest gain I count but loss,
    and pour contempt on all my pride.

    2.
    Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
    save in the death of Christ, my God;
    all the vain things that charm me most,
    I sacrifice them to his blood.

    3.
    See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
    sorrow and love flow mingled down.
    Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
    or thorns compose so rich a crown.

    4.
    Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    that were an offering far too small;
    love so amazing, so divine,
    demands my soul, my life, my all.

    Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

    3.
    Since I, who was undone and lost,
    Have pardon through His name and word;
    Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
    Save in the cross of Christ my Lord.

    4.
    Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    That were a tribute far too small;
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my life, my soul, my all.
