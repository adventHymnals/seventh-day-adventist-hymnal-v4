    1.
    Saviour, teach me day by day,
    Love’s sweet lesson to obey,
    Sweeter lesson cannot be,
    Loving Him who first loved me.

    2.
    With a child’s glad heart of love,
    At Thy bidding may I move,
    Prompt to serve and follow Thee,
    Loving Him who first loved me.

    3.
    Teach me I am not my own,
    I am Thine, and Thine alone;
    Thine to keep, to rule, to save
    From all sin that would enslave.

    4.
    Love in loving finds employ,
    In obedience all her joy;
    Ever new that joy will be,
    Loving Him who first loved me.

    5.
    Teach me thus Thy steps to trace,
    Strong to follow in Thy grace.
    Learning how to love from Thee,
    Loving Him who first loved me.
