    1.
    The King of love my Shepherd is,
    Whose goodness faileth never;
    I nothing lack if I am His,
    And He is mine forever.

    2.
    Where streams of living water flow
    My ransomed soul He leadeth,
    And, where the verdant pastures grow,
    With food celestial feedeth.

    3.
    Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,
    But yet in love He sought me,
    And on His shoulder gently laid,
    And home, rejoicing, brought me.

    4.
    And so through all the length of days
    Thy goodness faileth never;
    Good Shepherd! I would sing Thy praise
    Within Thy house forever.
