    1.
    While shepherds kept their watching
    O’er silent flocks by night,
    Behold throughout the heavens
    There shone a holy light.

    2.
    The shepherds feared and trembled
    When lo! Above the earth
    Rang out the angel chorus
    That hailed our Savior’s birth.

    3.
    Down in a lowly manger
    The humble Christ was born,
    And brought us God’s salvation
    That blessed Christmas morn.
