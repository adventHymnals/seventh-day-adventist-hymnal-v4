    1.
    As it fell upon a night
    In the winter weather,
    Angels bright in starry height
    Began to sing together.

    2.
    Shepherds sleeping on the plain
    Woke to see the glory,
    All amazed they stood and gazed
    And heard the angelsâ€™ story.

    3.
    Unto you a child is born
    In a manger lowly,
    Humble, He, yet born to be
    The King of Love most holy.

    4.
    Happy angels from afar,
    Cease your singing never!
    In excelsis gloria!
    Forever and forever.
