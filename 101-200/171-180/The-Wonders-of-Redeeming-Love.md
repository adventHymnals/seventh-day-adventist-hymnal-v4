    1.
    The wonders of redeeming love
    Our highest thoughts exceed;
    The Son of God comes from above
    For sinful man to bleed.

    2.
    He gives Himself, His life, His all,
    A sinless sacrifice.
    For man He drains the cup of gall,
    For man the victim dies.

    3.
    And now before His Fatherâ€™s face
    His precious blood He pleads;
    For those who seek the throne of grace
    His love still intercedes.

    4.
    He knows the frailties of our frame,
    For He has borne our grief;
    Our great High Priest once felt the same,
    And He can send relief.

    5.
    His love will not be satisfied,
    Till He in glory sees
    The faithful ones for whom He died
    From sin forever free.
