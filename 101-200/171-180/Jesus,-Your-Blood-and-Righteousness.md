    1.
    Jesus, your blood and righteousness
    My beauty are, my glorious dress;
    Mid flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
    With joy shall I lift up my head.

    2.
    Bold shall I stand in that great day,
    Cleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;
    For by your cross absolved I am
    From sin and guilt, from fear and shame.

    3.
    Lord, I believe your precious blood,
    Which at the mercy seat of God
    Pleads for the captivesâ€™ liberty,
    Was also shed in love for me.

    4.
    When from the dust of death I rise
    To claim my mansion in the skies,
    This then shall be my only plea:
    Christ Jesus lived and died for me.
