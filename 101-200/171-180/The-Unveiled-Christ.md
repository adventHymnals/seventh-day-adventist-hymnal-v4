    1.
    Once our blessed Christ of beauty
    Was veiled off from human views;
    But through suffering, death, and sorrow
    He has rent the veil in two.


    Refrain:
    O behold the Man of Sorrows!
    O behold Him in plain view!
    Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
    Since her rent the veil in two;
    Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
    Since her rent the veil in two.


    2.
    Yes, He is with God, the Father,
    Interceding there for you;
    For He is the Well beloved
    Since He rent the veil in two.


    Refrain:
    O behold the Man of Sorrows!
    O behold Him in plain view!
    Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
    Since her rent the veil in two;
    Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
    Since her rent the veil in two.

    3.
    Holy angels bow before Him,
    Men of earth give praises due;
    For He is the mighty Conqueror
    Since He rent the veil in two.

    Refrain:
    O behold the Man of Sorrows!
    O behold Him in plain view!
    Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
    Since her rent the veil in two;
    Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
    Since her rent the veil in two.
