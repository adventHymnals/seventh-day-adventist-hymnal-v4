    1.
    Thou didst leave Thy throne
    And Thy kingly crown
    When Thou camest to earth for me;
    But in Bethlehem’s home
    Was there found no room
    For Thy holy nativity.


    Refrain:
    O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee.


    2.
    Heaven’s arches rang
    When the angels sang
    Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
    But of lowly birth
    Didst Thou come to earth,
    And in greatest humility.


    Refrain:
    O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee.

    3.
    The foxes found rest,
    And the birds their nest
    In the shade of the forest tree;
    But Thy couch was the sod,
    O Thou Son of God,
    In the deserts of Galilee.


    Refrain:
    O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee.

    4.
    Thou camest, O Lord,
    With the living word
    That should set Thy people free;
    But with mocking scorn,
    And with crown of thorn,
    They bore Thee to Calvary.


    Refrain:
    O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee.

    5.
    When the heavens shall ring,
    And the angels sing,
    At Thy coming to victory,
    Let Thy voice call me home,
    Saying, “Yet there is room,
    There is room at My side for thee.”


    Refrain:
    O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee.

    Refrain:
    My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
    When Thou comest and callest for me.
