    1.
    Let us with a gladsome mind
    Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
    For His mercies shall endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure.

    2.
    He, with all commanding might,
    Filled the new made world with light:
    For His mercies shall endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure.

    3.
    All things living He does feed;
    His full hand supplies their need:
    For His mercies shall endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure.

    4.
    Let us then with gladsome mind
    Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
    For His mercies shall endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure.
