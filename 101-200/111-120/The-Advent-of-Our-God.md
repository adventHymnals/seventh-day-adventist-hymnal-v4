[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qRLXWIrfM22CLxN6BGHCuZ2nUxXdfi0%2D/edit?mode=html)






    1.
    The advent of our God
    With eager prayers we greet,
    And singing haste upon His road
    His coming reign to meet.

    2.
    The everlasting Son
    Was born to make us free;
    And He a servantâ€™s form put on
    To gain our liberty.

    3.
    As Judge, on clouds of light,
    He soon will come again,
    His scattered people to unite
    With them in heaven to reign.

    4.
    Praise to the incarnate Son
    Who comes to set us free,
    With Father, Spirit, ever one,
    To all eternity.
