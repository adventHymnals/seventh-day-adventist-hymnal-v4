    1.
    Angels we have heard on high
    Sweetly singing oâ€™er the plains,
    And the mountains in reply
    Echoing their joyous strains.


    Refrain:
    Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
    Gloria, in excelsis Deo!


    2.
    Shepherds, why this jubilee?
    Why your joyous strains prolong?
    What the gladsome tidings be
    Which inspire your heavenly song?


    Refrain:
    Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
    Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

    3.
    Come to Bethlehem and see
    Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
    Come, adore on bended knee,
    Christ the Lord, the newborn King.


    Refrain:
    Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
    Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

    4.
    See Him in a manger laid,
    Whom the choirs of angels praise;
    Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
    While our hearts in love we raise.

    Refrain:
    Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
    Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
