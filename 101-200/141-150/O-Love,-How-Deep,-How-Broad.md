    1.
    O love, how deep, how broad, how high,
    Beyond all thought and fantasy,
    That God, the Son of God, should take
    Our mortal form for mortal’s sake!

    2.
    For us baptized, for us He bore
    His holy fast and hungered sore;
    For us temptation sharp He knew;
    For us the tempter overthrew.

    3.
    For us by wickedness betrayed,
    For us, in crown of thorns arrayed,
    He bore the shameful cross and death;
    For us He gave His dying breath.

    4.
    For us He rose from death again,
    For us He went on high to reign;
    For us He sent His Spirit here
    To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.

    5.
    All glory to our Lord and God
    For love so deep, so high, so broad;
    The Trinity whom we adore
    Forevermore and forevermore.
