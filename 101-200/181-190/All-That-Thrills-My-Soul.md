    1.
    Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
    By His presence all divine?
    True and tender, pure and precious,
    Oh, how blest to call Him mine!


    Refrain:
    All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
    He is more than life to me; (to me;)
    And the fairest of ten thousand,
    In my blessed Lord I see.


    2.
    Love of Christ so freely given,
    Grace of God beyond degree,
    Mercy higher than the heaven,
    Deeper than the deepest sea.


    Refrain:
    All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
    He is more than life to me; (to me;)
    And the fairest of ten thousand,
    In my blessed Lord I see.

    3.
    Every need His hand supplying,
    Every good in Him I see;
    On His strength divine relying,
    He is All in All to me.


    Refrain:
    All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
    He is more than life to me; (to me;)
    And the fairest of ten thousand,
    In my blessed Lord I see.

    4.
    By the crystal flowing river
    With the ransomed I will sing,
    And forever and forever
    Praise and glorify the King.

    Refrain:
    All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
    He is more than life to me; (to me;)
    And the fairest of ten thousand,
    In my blessed Lord I see.
