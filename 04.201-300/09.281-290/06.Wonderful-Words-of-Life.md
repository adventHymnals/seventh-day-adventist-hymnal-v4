Sing them over again to me,
wonderful words of life,
Let me more of their beauty see,
wonderful words of life;
Words of life and beauty
teach me faith and duty.

Beautiful words, wonderful words,
wonderful words of life,
Beautiful words, wonderful words,
wonderful words of life.

Christ, the bless√®d One, gives to all

Sinner, list to the loving call,
wonderful words of life;
All so freely given,
wooing us to heaven.

Beautiful words, wonderful words,

Beautiful words, wonderful words,
wonderful words of life.
