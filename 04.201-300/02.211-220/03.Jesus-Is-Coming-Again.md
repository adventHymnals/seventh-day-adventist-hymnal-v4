1.
Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring:
Jesus is coming again!
Cheer up, ye pilgrims, be joyful and sing:
Jesus is coming again!


Refrain:
Coming again, coming again,
Jesus is coming again!


2.
Echo it, hilltops; proclaim it, ye plains:
Jesus is coming again!
Coming in glory, the Lamb that was slain;
Jesus is coming again!


Refrain:
Coming again, coming again,
Jesus is coming again!

3.
Heavings of earth, tell the vast, wondering throng:
Jesus is coming again!
Tempests and whirlwinds, the anthem prolong;
Jesus is coming again!


Refrain:
Coming again, coming again,
Jesus is coming again!

4.
Nations are angryâ€“by this we do know
Jesus is coming again!
Knowledge increases; men run to and fro;
Jesus is coming again!

Refrain:
Coming again, coming again,
Jesus is coming again!
