#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
I’ve wandered far away from God,
Now I’m coming home;
The paths of sin too long I’ve trod;
Lord, I’m coming home.


Refrain:
Coming home, coming home
Never more to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord I’m coming home.


2.
I’ve wasted many precious years,
Now I’m coming home;
I now repent with bitter tears;
Lord, I’m coming home.


Refrain:
Coming home, coming home
Never more to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord I’m coming home.

3.
I’m tired of sin and straying Lord,
Now I’m coming home;
I’ll trust thy love belive thy word;
Lord I’m coming home.


Refrain:
Coming home, coming home
Never more to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord I’m coming home.

4.
My only hope, my only plea,
Now I’m coming home;
That Jesus died, and died for me;
Lord I’m coming home.


Refrain:
Coming home, coming home
Never more to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord I’m coming home.

5.
I need His cleansing blood I know,
Now I’m coming home;
O wash me whiter than the snow;
Lord I’m coming home.

Refrain:
Coming home, coming home
Never more to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord I’m coming home.
