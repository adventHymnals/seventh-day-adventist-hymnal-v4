## 278. LORD JESUS, ONCE YOU SPOKE TO MEN
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Lord Jesus, once You spoke to men
Upon the mountain and the plain,
O help us listen now as then
And wonder at Your words again.

2.
We all have secret fears to face,
Our minds and motives to amend.
We seek Your truth,
We need your grace,
Our living Lord and present friend.

3.
The gospel speaks; and we receive
Your light, Your love,
Your own command.
O help us live what we believe,
In daily word of heart and hand.
