#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
Thanks to God whose Word was spoken
In the deed that made the earth.
His the voice that called a nation;
His the fires that tried her worth.
God has spoken;
Praise Him For His open Word

2.
Thanks to God whose Word incarnate
Glorified the flesh of man.
Deeds and words and death and rising
Tell the grace in heaven’s plan.
God has spoken;
Praise Him For His open Word

3.
Thanks to God whose Word is answered
By the Spirit’s voice within.
Here we drink of joy unmeasured,
Life redeemed from death and sin.
God has spoken;
Praise Him For His open Word
