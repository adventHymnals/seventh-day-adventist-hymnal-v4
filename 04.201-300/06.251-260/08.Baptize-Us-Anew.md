1.
Baptize us anew With power from on high,
With love, O refresh us! Dear Savior, draw nigh.


Refrain:
We humbly beseech Thee, Lord Jesus, we pray,
With love and the Spirit baptize us today.
We praise Thee, we bless Thee, dear Lamb that was slain
We laud and adore Thee, Amen and Amen.


2.
Unworthy we cry, Unholy, unclean,
O wash us and cleanse us From sinâ€™s guilty stain.


Refrain:
We humbly beseech Thee, Lord Jesus, we pray,
With love and the Spirit baptize us today.
We praise Thee, we bless Thee, dear Lamb that was slain
We laud and adore Thee, Amen and Amen.

3.
O heavenly Dove, Descend from on high!
We plead Thy rich blessing; In mercy draw nigh.


Refrain:
We humbly beseech Thee, Lord Jesus, we pray,
With love and the Spirit baptize us today.
We praise Thee, we bless Thee, dear Lamb that was slain
We laud and adore Thee, Amen and Amen.

4.
O list the glad voice! From heaven it came:
Thou art My beloved, Well pleased I am.

Refrain:
We humbly beseech Thee, Lord Jesus, we pray,
With love and the Spirit baptize us today.
We praise Thee, we bless Thee, dear Lamb that was slain
We laud and adore Thee, Amen and Amen.
