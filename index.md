# INTRODUCTION

The Scriptures echo with the sound of singing. At Creation "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy" (Job 38:7). The psalmist declared, "I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being" (Ps. 104:33). The apostle Paul wanted the members of the church at Colossae to encourage one another in the faith with "psalms and hymns and spiritual songs" (Col. 3:16). The first angel of Revelation 14 asks God's people to "give glory to him;... and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters" (verse 7).

This hymnal can be used to lead congregations into ==more creative== and significant ways of praising God, a deeper love for Jesus Christ, a keener awareness of the church's place and mission in the world, a fresh knowledge of God's will for each life, and a preparation for our Lord's second coming.

James White recalled that in the early days of the Advent movement in America "there was... a power in what was called Advent singing, such as was felt in no other." - *Life Incidents,* p. 94. From their beginning, Seventh-day Adventists have been a singing people. The very first book they published was the 1849 collection of *Hymns for God's Peculiar People That Keep the Commandments of God and the Faith of Jesus*. James White published five hymnals and four supplements even before the church was formally organized in 1863. White drew freely from the musical heritage of the Methodists, Baptists, and other denominations. He also carried forward some of the "white spirituals" from the *Millennial Harp *of Joshua V. Himes, and added a few new hymns by Adventist authors Uriah and Annie Smith and Roswell F. Cottrell. Hymns such as "Gracious Father, Guard Thy Children" and "Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken" have survived in every hymnal since the first.

A few of the spiritual songs from this early period have been included in the Early Advent section of the hymnal to provide a resource for the celebration of the church's heritage. ~~While they may not always reach the musical standard of the great hymns of the church~~, they nevertheless remind us of the fervent faith of our pioneers.

The first "official" Seventh-day Adventist hymnal was Hymns and Tunes for Those Who Keep the Commandments of God and the Faith of Jesus, issued in 1869. This served until The Seventh-day Adventist Hymn and Tune Book (Hymns and Tunes) was issued in 1886. Even though James White had died in 1881, the influence of his family was still felt in Adventist hymnody. His son J. Edson White set the musical type for the new hymnal and his nephew Franklin Belden served as musical editor, along with Edwin Barnes, an expatriate Englishman who served as organist in the denomination's largest church, the Battle Creek Tabernacle.

In 1908 Franklin Belden produced *Christ in Song*, a "tuneful" and rhythmic collection much loved by congregations. Indeed, ==popular demand has led the Church Hymnal Committee to restore some selections from Belden's hymnal==. The next major collection, **The Church Hymnal**, appeared in 1941. Professor H. B. Hannum played a major role in that collection. In retirement, he offered encouragement and practical advice that enriched this new hymnal as well. Although the average life of a church hymnal is about twenty-five years, Seventh-day Adventists have waited far longer to replace their 1941 volume. Meanwhile, we have issued a number of smaller collections for special purposes. ~~At length it was clear that the church would profit from a new hymnal.~~ Old favorites from many sources needed to be recovered. Hymns that had not achieved acceptance needed to be set aside in favor of fine new compositions. ==New tunes, wedded to familiar texts,== promised to revitalize some hymns, while in other cases the reverse was true - new poems accompanied by familiar music could give fresh expression to the church's faith. ==Church services needed the energy and meaning that additional worship aids could provide.==

In response to these needs the General Conference Music Committee supported the Review and Herald Publishing Association in the development of *The Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal*. As plans progressed, the General Conference Committee, in Annual Council, endorsed the project. A nineteen-member Church Hymnal Committee was appointed under the direction of C. L. Brooks, chairman, and Wayne Hooper, executive secretary. The committee included music teachers, choir leaders, organists, composers, writers, editors, soloists, evangelists, pastors, and church administrators. The broad diversity of the Seventh-day Adventist Church was represented by men and women, black and white, clergymen and laypersons, academics and administrators. In addition, members of a large advisory committee reviewed the work and offered suggestions as it progressed.

## How Hymns Were Chosen

The committee has sought hymns well suited for congregational singing and ==examined each one for scriptural and doctrinal soundness.== They prized music that would be attractive both to old and young worshipers, and texts that recognized the diversity of cultures among the English-speaking church members who will use the hymnal. They mined the treasures of Christian hymnody past and present. They selected favorites from our Adventist heritage and gospel songs both old and new. They sought ==hymns that affirm the distinctive beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists== as well as ==those that express points of faith we hold in common with other Christian bodies.==

The selection process did not rely, however, on the tastes of the committee members only. Hundreds of pastors and laypersons sent suggestions to the committee. More than three thousand ministers in North America and Australia were asked to rate each hymn in the 1941 *Church Hymnal* according to whether they would retain or delete it. In response, the committee retained widely used hymns along with those that bore important spiritual messages or enjoyed hallowed associations. ==In order to make room for hymns of greater merit and beauty, they omitted some of marginal poetic or musical value.== The international character of the Seventh-day Adventist Church dictated that patriotic hymns tied to a single nation be passed over. Hymns well adapted to congregational singing were given precedence over compositions intended for choirs or soloists.

New hymns were drawn from many sources. ==Hymnals old and new provided texts and tunes of enduring value from other churches. Sometimes it was necessary to alter the text of these hymns to eliminate theological aberrations or awkward, jarring expressions.== With great caution, the text committee replaced archaic and exclusive language whenever this could be done without disturbing familiar phrases, straining fond attachments, or doing violence to historical appropriateness.

Musically the hymnal was improved with the addition of a number of American folk hymns and Negro spirituals as well as German chorales and old psaltery tunes. The hymnal includes a few modern gospel songs along with several striking new works by Adventist authors and composers.

## How to Use the Hymnal

A survey of a typical hymnal page will aid the worshiper in the use of the hymnal. The title is the first line of the hymn-poem, except for those gospel songs in which a phrase from elsewhere in the text is more familiar. Both first line and familiar title are listed in the alphabetical index. To the left is found a Bible reference if the hymn is based on a specific passage. Below that appear the author's name, the date the hymn was written, and the author's birth and death dates. Occasionally the source of the text is given instead of the author.

On the right is the name of the hymn tune if it has a name. Next on the right of the page is a set of numbers indicating the metrical pattern of the poem, which is simply the number of syllables in each line (such as LM for long meter, or 8.8.8.8.). By referring to the Metrical Index one can find other tunes in the same meter that might fit the text and add interest to the singing. Where the same tune is actually printed with different texts elsewhere in the hymnal, the tune is sometimes written in a different key or with a different harmonization, and a cross-reference is noted at the bottom of the page. Cross-references are also used to suggest alternative tunes that are especially well adapted to a particular text. Just above the musical staff on the right of the page is the known information about the composer or source of the music.

Sometimes the word *unison* is printed above the staff to indicate music that is best interpreted if all sing the melody together. Of course, hymns written in four-part harmony can be sung in unison whenever desired. ==Nevertheless, to make unison singing more enjoyable for all, the pitch of many familiar hymns has been lowered.==

To the left, below the music, is the copyright information if the hymn is still protected by copyright. This means the publisher has the right to print the hymn in this book only. For any other use of the hymn one must secure permission from the owner of the copyright. Any errors or omissions in the printing of copyright information will gladly be corrected in future printings. Throughout the hymnal, gospel songs and great hymns stand together in topical clusters. The worship aids in the back of the hymnal offer readings, calls to worship, words of assurance, offertory sentences, and benedictions, all drawn from the words of Scripture. The hymnal includes suggestions for using these worship aids, and congregations will enjoy exploring new applications of their own.

In addition to the standard indexes, the "finding aids" include a list entitled Hymns Suitable for Young Worshipers, a canonically arranged index of scriptural allusions in hymns (with special thanks to Edward E. White), a scripture index to the worship aids, and an extensive topical index.

## Purpose of the Hymnal

Ellen White, cofounder and spiritual leader of our church, noted that "the soul may ascend nearer heaven on the wings of praise." - *Steps to Christ*, p. 104. "Singing," she said, ". . . is as much an act of worship as is prayer." - *Patriarchs of Prophets*, p. 594. This hymnal is designed to help Seventh-day Adventists continue this chorus of praise that cheered God's ancient people, encouraged the early church, powered the Reformation, and brightens the fellowship of those who share the "blessed hope."
