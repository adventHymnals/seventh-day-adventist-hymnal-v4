## 302. DEEPER YET
#### Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal

```txt



1.
In the blood from the cross,
I have been washed from sin;
But to be free from dross,
Still I would enter in.


Refrain:
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.


2.
Day by day, hour by hour,
Blessings are sent to me;
But for more of His power,
Ever my prayer shall be.


Refrain:
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.

3.
Near to Christ I would live,
Following Him each day;
What I ask He will give;
So then with faith I pray.


Refrain:
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.

4.
Now I have peace, sweet peace,
While in this world of sin;
But to pray Iâ€™ll not cease
Till I am pure within.

Refrain:
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.
