## 66. GOD BE WITH YOU

```txt
1.
God be with you till we meet again;
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you:
God be with you till we meet again.

2.
God be with you till we meet again;
Neath His wings securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you:
God be with you till we meet again.

3.
God be with you till we meet again;
When life’s perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you:
God be with you till we meet again.

4.
God be with you till we meet again;
Keep love’s banner floating o’er you,
Smite death’s threatening wave before you:
God be with you till we meet again.
